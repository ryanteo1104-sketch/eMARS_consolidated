This upper level area was partially closed on the side and adjacent to the finished products store (polyurethane sandwich panels).

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION: In a sodium hypochlorite transfer tank, an unknown amount of sodium hypochlorite flowed into the overfilling pipe owing to the blockage of the float valve (due to the presence of crystals) that controlled the level in the tank. Therefore, when the level reached the maximum value, the valve did not stop the pump. The overfilling pipe was connected with a tank installed below, covered with a metal grid, which was containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The reaction of the sodium hypochlorite with the two acids produced chlorine gas and probably fluoride gas. The release occurred at 08:45 am. In the area there were 6 employees and each of them noticed a strong smell of chlorine and left the building as soon as possible. The security department was immediately alerted which in turn alerted the medical service and the management. A 4 men rescue team was formed and instructed to enter the pickling section to check if someone was still there. They were also instructed to switch-off the equipment. The rescue team found that the sodium hydroxide transfer tank had overflowed and the liquid had run into the tank below containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The pump which was transferring the sodium hypochloryte from the storage tank to the transfer tank had already stopped. Since chlorine gas is heavier than air, it was expected that it would take some time for the chlorine vapours to disperse from the building. At about 17:00 hours the production was started up again since no more than 1ppm concentration of chlorine could be detected in the production hall by means of Draeger tubes.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

This plant had been shut-down in June from 1 to 23. When it was started up problems were experienced in stabilizing the column and a number of repairs were made to the pumps and instrumentation. On the day of the explosion, the column was sufficiently stable. When the explosion occurred all the employees were by chance in the control room. No alarm signals sounded during the last 30 minutes before the explosion occurred except the general alarm that sounded a few seconds before. Despite of the difficult internal communication caused by the destruction of the internal telephone and alarm systems and the emergency control centre, the operators started to shut-down the other plants of the factory and to fight the fire. The external emergency services and the authorities were informed on the accident and the emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was activated. The emergency services arrived on site in 10 minutes and with the help of the factory's operators put out the fire and the release of chemicals within half an hour. 13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP Chemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a neighbouring factory) were slightly hurt. The most serious injury was a broken arm. There were considerable damages inside the establishment: the redistillation column (32 metres high and 2.3 metres in diameter) was completely destroyed and pieces were found up to 700 metres away, some in a neighbouring factory. The ethylene oxide plant and other nearby plants were seriously damaged. Most of the buildings in a radius of 300 metres were damaged. The internal alarm and telephone systems were damaged and could not be used. The emergency control room was also unusable.

This plant had been shut-down in June from 1 to 23. When it was started up problems were experienced in stabilizing the column and a number of repairs were made to the pumps and instrumentation. On the day of the explosion, the column was sufficiently stable. When the explosion occurred all the employees were by chance in the control room. No alarm signals sounded during the last 30 minutes before the explosion occurred except the general alarm that sounded a few seconds before. Despite of the difficult internal communication caused by the destruction of the internal telephone and alarm systems and the emergency control centre, the operators started to shut-down the other plants of the factory and to fight the fire. The external emergency services and the authorities were informed on the accident and the emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was activated. The emergency services arrived on site in 10 minutes and with the help of the factory's operators put out the fire and the release of chemicals within half an hour. 13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP Chemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a neighbouring factory) were slightly hurt. The most serious injury was a broken arm. There were considerable damages inside the establishment: the redistillation column (32 metres high and 2.3 metres in diameter) was completely destroyed and pieces were found up to 700 metres away, some in a neighbouring factory. The ethylene oxide plant and other nearby plants were seriously damaged. Most of the buildings in a radius of 300 metres were damaged. The internal alarm and telephone systems were damaged and could not be used. The emergency control room was also unusable. Outside the establishment, window panes were broken in neighbouring factories and the nearby village of Zwijndrecht (about 1 km away).

The leak was caused by a hair-crack due to low cycle fatigue. The released ethylene oxide reacted with moisture to form non-volatile polyethylene glycols (PEG) in the insulation material. PEG accumulated in the course of time. On the day of the accident, the metal covering of the insulation was removed in order to repair the level indicator. Air leaked into the insulation material already soaked with PEG, causing its decomposition and initiating auto-oxidation. The auto-oxidation of the PEG ignited the insulation and the resulting heat flux heated the metal wall of the piping of the level instrumentation system. The heating of the stagnant liquid of the level instrument stand pipe caused the ethylene oxide to decompose. The decomposition continued into the column K-303 which exploded (the confined vapour explosion began in the lower section of the column). The gas supply line to column K-302 (carrying gases from the head of column K-303) was torn off and the escaping gas caught fire.

After a pressure decrease down to 5 bar the pipe was unblocked and contemporaneously was released a certain quantity of phenol. The probable cause was the opening of a relief valve or of the vessel deck (over the ship) which was still under air pressure. Two seamen received phenol on their body (which is very dangerous in contact with the skin) notwithstanding they had gloves, special dresses and protective cask. This was due to the fact that the various protections were not perfectly linked between them. A seaman died one hour later, the other was hospitalised with serious chemical burns.

The bund is made of earth. The terminal is situated at some distance from the refinery it is connected with.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 large crude oil tanks of which 3 are situated in a row and a fourth crude oil tank is situated before the second tank. These storage tanks are identified as D1, D2, D3 and D4;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 smaller slop oil tanks, D10 and D11;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very small crude oil tank D26.The crude oil tanks D1, D2, D3 and D4 have a capacity of 40 000 m3 and the slop oil tanks D10 and D11 have a capacity of 24 000 m3.The crude oil is delivered by pipeline and is pumped by pipeline to the Refinery.On September 12th, 2005 a minor incident occurred at the storage tank D3. During this incident an amount of 35 m3 crude oil leaked from the bottom of the tank. The exact cause of this incident is not yet known. At the moment the major accident occurred with tank D2 cleaning operations for storage tank D3 were just started in order to inspect storage tank D3 and to determine the causes of the incident of September 12th.At the moment the major accident happened the slop oil tank D10 was full, the slop oil tank D11 was empty, the crude oil tank D4 was partially full, the crude oil tank D2 was for 75% full en the tanks D1, D3 en D26 were empty and in revision.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chronological description of the accident and the interventionOn October 25, 2005 around 18.15h a major leak at tank D2 was detected. Storage tank D2 contained at that moment almost 33 000 m3 crude oil. Information from the DCS-system situated in the off-sites control room of the refinery indicates that the full inventory of storage tank D2 was released within 10 minutes. Because the contents of the storage tank was released in such a short time, an enormous wave appeared. Due to the amount of crude that was released, the bund was filled ( 40 000 m2 large) with crude up to&nbsp; a height of 1 m. Due to the effect of the crude wave, a small amount of 3 m3 of crude was ejected out of the bund into a nearby creek.After the release the storage tank was leaning forward. It also seamed that the storage tank was sledded of his foundation, although it is not clear if this was a cause or rather a consequence of the incident. Initially the fire brigade started to cover the bund with fire fighting foam to avoid ignition of the crude oil and to reduce the smell. Directly a large amount of fire fighting foam was donated by the Refinery, other (petro)chemical companies and the fire brigade to cover the very large bund area with foam.&nbsp; Due to the very strong wind that evening and the use of different types of fire fighting foam they did not succeeded to cover the whole bund with foam. Especially the inner part of the large bund (where al the piping and valves are situated) stayed even after several hours uncovered. On the other hand the strong wind had the advantage that no explosive atmosphere was formed above the spill.The contents of the slop oil tank D10 and the crude oil tank D4 was immediatly pumped to storage tanks situated at the refinery itself. The contents of the bund is firstly pumped to the slop oil tank D11. In order to fill the slop oil tank D10 and de crude oil tank D4 with the product in the bund, some manual valves had to be handled. Because of the presence of piping, valves and walking platforms in the bund, is was not possible to reach the valves by boat. Therefore two operators (fully protected with chemical overalls and breathing apparatus) have walked through the crude and manipulated the valves.During the next two days the mixture of crude oil, fire fighting foam and water was pumped to the storage tanks D10 and D4. This was done at a velocity of 900 m3 an hour. Afterwards a part of this mixture was send to storage tanks at the refinery. In the afternoon of October 27th , 2005 the bund was mostly empty, except of some smaller pools of crude oil. These pools were removed by vacuum cleaning trucks.On October 28th, 2005 the intervention was finished and the cleaning up of the terminal could start. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommentsThe storage tank D2 was built in 1970. At that moment the storage terminal belonged to XX. It was sold in 1990 to the Refinery. At that moment all the tanks were inspected and repaired if necessary. This was also the case for storage tank D2. The inspection before the tank D2 was used again was done in 1991. From 1994 until now each 3 years an external inspection was performed. These inspections showed almost no remarks. Next year a total revision of the storage tank was planned. Every three years setting measurements of the storage tanks were carried out. The last measurements were done in 2004. These measurements showed no anomalies.At this moment the cause of this major accident is not yet know. There are some indications that a subsidence (movement of the soil) could have caused this accident, because one month before this accident the crude oil tank D3 also had a leak. More investigation on both tanks is necessary to know if both accidents are related with each other.Two days after the accident, the bund was nearly empty. At that moment it was clearly visible that a part of the foundation of storage tank D2 had disappeared. Parts of the foundation were found in the bund over a distance of 20 to 30 m. An important concern after the accident is the stability of all storage tanks at the storage terminal at the left bank. For the moment each day setting measurements are performed. To reduce the risk of another release, most part of the contents of the storage tanks D4, D10 and D11 are pumped to the refinery where it was shipped to Rotterdam. Afterwards these tanks were partially filled with water in order to let the roof float.For the moment the terminal only contains sludge. This sludge is present in the storage tanks D4, D10, D11 and D2.After the accident the company organized already 8 inspections with the authorities in order to discuss al measures they are taking concerning safety and environment. Also a public hearing for the neighbourhood was organized.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean-up operationsThe Refinery has set up a project group in order to make the terminal safe and start the cleaning of the terminal.In order to reduce the smell in the neighbourhood. The bund area is covered with sand, except the zone in front of the storage tank D2. Because the tank is leaning forward, it was not safe to enter the bund and in that area a lot of sludge was still present. This sludge containing a lot of sand is very viscous and has an average depth of 1 m.From November 6th, 2005 the storage tank D2 is stabilized by 4 mayor cranes. These cranes that can support the total mass of the storage tank are placed on a service way just outside the bund.After the stabilisation of the storage tank D2, two manholes of the storage tank were opened. Measurements indicated that the atmosphere in the storage tank was not explosive. They also saw that the floating roof had properly landed on his supports (legs). Nevertheless the company does not want operators to enter the storage tank to remove the sludge. For that reason they have ordered a robot to suck the sludge out of the storage tank.In the next week a profound investigation of the soil will start. Firstly drillings until a depth of 2 to 3 m will be performed to measure the soil contamination. Afterwards drilling until a depth of 25 to 30 m will be performed to measure the stability of the soil at the terminal and in the surroundings.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

During the loading of red gas oil&nbsp; from a land tank to a ship an overfilling of one of the tanks on the ship occurred. The overfilling went on for about 20 minutes before the loading operation was stopped. As a result, 193 m# of the product was released in the surface water.

Actions takenAfter an alarm was given on the ship by the crew (at 5.50 am) refinery personnel interrupted the loading operation by activating the emergency stop on the land side. The loading pumps were stopped from the dispatch centre, and the loading arm was closed at the quay. Absorption materials were placed at the front and the back of the ship. The authorities were informed. Two specialised companies were contacted to fight the water pollution. The dock was closed for shipping movements for four days during the cleaning operation. Origin, causes and circumstances of the accidentAfter filling the fourth tank on the ship tank four was closed by the shipper. Then he wanted to open tank number 5 on the ship, but he wrongly opened again tank number four. As this tank was already filled up, an overfilling occurred ' human error.&nbsp; The tanks of the ship were not equipped with an overfill detection system to stop the feed pumps at he land side automatically when activated. Thus, the loading operation could go on for about 20 minutes after tank four was already completely filled up ' insufficient technical measures.There was insufficient supervision during the loading operation: neither the crew of the ship, neither the refinery personnel noticed the overfilling which went on for 20 minutes '",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

In these ovens the feed stream naphtha is cracked into smaller molecules. Periodically these ovens need to be decoked to assure an optimal cracking of the molecules. When the accident took place the oven B20 had to be decoked.&nbsp; To start the decoking procedure, the feed to the oven must be closed. Next the oven must be flushed with steam. Afterwards an air flow is sent into the oven to burn the carbon, which is deposed at the inner walls of the cracking tubes, in a controlled manner. Around 19.15h the naphtha feed to the oven B20 was stopped by closing a automatic valve. The 4 control valves (not at the entrance of the oven were also closed. The operator in the control room performed these actions. After performing these remote actions, some manual operations had to take place in the neighbourhood of the ovens.&nbsp;The manual actions that had to be performed were the following ones:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First a manual valve placed just before the automatic valve on the naphtha feed had to be closed. In a report figure, this manual valve is situated left from the automatic valve;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next the naphtha feed line had to be flushed with steam for a short period (called short steam flush).

The specific distillation column K23 was shut down at the time of the incident for scheduled maintenance when a heat exchanger exploded and the cumene ignited. The automatic systems for foaming were activated and the on-site emergency services were quickly on the scene. They were joined by the external emergency services. The fire was extinguished at 15.23. &nbsp;Two firemen were taken to hospital having come into contact with cumene, a mild irritant. They were released following check-up and have suffered no long-term effects. There was no environmental issue outside of the plant area and there was no risk to the local community. It was found that there was an unexpected accumulation of methyl hydroperoxide (MHP) in the upper part of column K23 during normal operation. During the shut down of the column, the MHP was enriched in the aqueous side draw. Because of specific circumstances parts of this water could flow into the hot heat exchanger, where a thermal explosion of the MHP containing liquid led to an over pressurization of the apparatus. The explosion tore off the feed and outlet pipes. Cumene mainly leaked from the long pipe towards a buffer tank and ignited. &nbsp;Cumene is a colorless, flammable liquid.INCIDENT DESCRIPTIONOn Sunday April 9th K23 was being shutdown in order to perform a regulatory inspection of the column reboiler.&nbsp; The shutdown of K23 was being conducted as outlined in the procedure. The first focus in shutting down K23 was stopping the feed and evacuating the bottom of the column. At 13.17, the feed to K23 from the Cumene Extraction Unit was stopped by closing a manual valve at the Cumene Extraction Unit.&nbsp; At approximately the same time, the level controller for the sump of K23 was placed in manual operation with a fixed valve position to allow K23 to be pumped empty to Tank 93. The level of K23's sump immediately began to decrease, reaching 10% by 13.19.&nbsp; The level remained stable at 10%, although material was continually pumped from K23.&nbsp; This is an indication that the level transmitter was not reporting correctly and that the actual level was below the lower nozzle of the level instrument.&nbsp; Based on calculations, it is estimated that approximately 1 m3 of material remained in K23 below the lower nozzle of its level instrument.&nbsp; At 13.25, K23's bottom pump began to cavitate, indicating that the column was nearly empty, and was shut down at 13.28.&nbsp; The bottoms product from K23 is cooled by the feed in a preheater (WBG2336).&nbsp; Having already shut off the feed to K23, there was no cooling of the bottoms product as indicated by a temperature rise on the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93. This temperature indicator reached a maximum temperature of 128 °C at 13.24, which is the same time that K23 was empty.The second focus in shutting down K23 was preventing low boiling components from entering the bottom of the column. To ensure that the low boiling components remained in the overheads of the column, the steam flow controller was placed in manual operation at 13.19 and steam input was reduced over a three-minute period.&nbsp; At 13.25 the steam condensate temperature increased indicating that heat transfer was no longer taking place due to K23's sump being empty.&nbsp; At 13.29, the steam flow was stopped by placing the controller at 0% output.&nbsp; The interface level in BBG2305 began increasing at 13.25, indicating the accumulation of additional water in this vessel.&nbsp; This level increase was a combined result of shutting off the steam flow to K23 and continuing to reflux material from BBG2303 to the top of K23.&nbsp; At 13.39, the reflux flow controller was placed in manual operation at 0% output.&nbsp; At 13.54, BBG2305's level controller was placed in manual control at a fixed valve position of 10%.&nbsp; The outlet flow from BBG2305 was estimated to be 25 liter/min and resulted in a continuous decrease of the aqueous level in BBG2305.&nbsp; At 13.58, the aqueous level in BBG2305 went to 0%, indicating that organic material was then being pumped from BBG2305 to Tank 93.At approximately 14.00 an explosion occurred at WBG2336, which resulted in a fire in the South West corner of Distillation Unit 1.

To ensure that the low boiling components remained in the overheads of the column, the steam flow controller was placed in manual operation at 13.19 and steam input was reduced over a three-minute period.&nbsp; At 13.25 the steam condensate temperature increased indicating that heat transfer was no longer taking place due to K23's sump being empty.&nbsp; At 13.29, the steam flow was stopped by placing the controller at 0% output.&nbsp; The interface level in BBG2305 began increasing at 13.25, indicating the accumulation of additional water in this vessel.&nbsp; This level increase was a combined result of shutting off the steam flow to K23 and continuing to reflux material from BBG2303 to the top of K23.&nbsp; At 13.39, the reflux flow controller was placed in manual operation at 0% output.&nbsp; At 13.54, BBG2305's level controller was placed in manual control at a fixed valve position of 10%.&nbsp; The outlet flow from BBG2305 was estimated to be 25 liter/min and resulted in a continuous decrease of the aqueous level in BBG2305.&nbsp; At 13.58, the aqueous level in BBG2305 went to 0%, indicating that organic material was then being pumped from BBG2305 to Tank 93.At approximately 14.00 an explosion occurred at WBG2336, which resulted in a fire in the South West corner of Distillation Unit 1. The sprinkler and foam systems for Distillation Unit 1 were immediately activated. The site emergency response team quickly responded to the incident and was later joined by outside emergency services. The fire could not be extinguished until 15.23 due to being unable to successfully isolate fuel sources from the fire.",incident type > explosion > vapor explosion,46.0,2,incident type > explosion > Other (depth-capped)

One of the gaskets on the flange connection on the outlet pipe of the tank had failed. The head of the operations department tried to stop the leak by tying a rubber belt around the flanges. In the meantime, an operator sprayed lots of water on the flange to avoid contact with phenol as much as possible.The phenol that had leaked was collected in the catchment pit of 20 m# underneath the pump house. Afterwards the spray water was added to it. This catchment pit had a high level alarm, but that was not functioning at the time of the leak. The malfunctioning was not known by the company at that time because the alarm wasn't inspected periodically. An attempt was made to close the only manual valve on the pipe, located between the inner and the outer tank shells. But the valve broke off during this manipulation. So the line couldn't be shut off. After the temporary repair of the flange connection, three trickles of phenol kept on spraying, which were also collected in the catchment tank. It wasn't allowed for the employees to enter the pump house for as long as the phenol was leaking.To clean up the catchment pit, the company disposes of a waste tank, which is big enough to contain all leaked and leaking phenol. When starting to pump the phenol from the catchment tank to the waste tank, it was discovered that the catchment pit did overflow. Part of the phenol/water mixture had flown over the rim of the open pit into the municipal sewer system. At the time, it was not yet known how much phenol had leaked to the sewer system.On Monday January 7th 2008 it was decided to start up the phenol based batch production to consume all phenol in the storage tank as the phenol tank had to be taken out of service in order to replace the gasket on the flange. On Tuesday January 8th, after a few batch productions, it was found out that the level indicator in the phenol storage tank got stuck since the last control of the level on Friday 4th (comparison of manual level measurement with level indicator). Only at that moment the company realised how much phenol had leaked out of the tank: about 25 tonnes! Most of it should have been collected in the catchment pit, so it was recuperated. But a part of the phenol, more than 5 tonnes, got in the municipal sewer. As far as is known, there was no external damage reported.A specialised company came on site to repair the (remaining) phenol leak with a temporary, but solid solution. Afterwards, when the flanges and valves were replaced, it was found out that the valve broke down because the gasket next to it had been reacting with phenol during many years, leading to a solid deformation preventing the valve to move.",phenol,4.0,3,phenol

Due to the heavy inundation of chlorine Mr. Juris returned to the adjacent building for breathing equipment. He then informed Mr. Kubist, manager of the chlorine, lye and ATA production, who at 7:52 called for the fire services (extension 150). After entering the inundated storage area, Mr. Juris attempted to determine the source of the leakage. He discovered that the liquid chlorine was leaking from the top of tank 8, where the pump was located. He supposed that the chlorine delivery route from the pump was broken, as the leak occurred at the moment the pump was turned on.In difficult conditions and with minimal visibility he closed the armature of the delivery pump above the lid of the tank and opened the armature of the deaeration tank to the chlorine production. He then left the storage area and switched off the storage area ventilation system. In the meantime, Mr. Kubista activated the emergency shutdown in the sodium chloride production hall. The fire services arrived at 7:55 am. A third degree chemical alarm was sounded at 7:56 am. At this time wind direction was 278° (westerly) and velocity was 0.5 m/s.

At the same time, Mr. Stastny switched off the electricity in building E 4990. The tenzometric scales and pressure and temperature measurements of the chlorine tanks in the store ceased to operate. After the arrival of the fire services, Mr. Juris and Mr. Kubista briefed them on the severity of the situation and that the liquid chlorine is probably leaking from the pump's feed pipe in tank 8. In light of the fact that after closing the delivery vent of the pump the intensity of the leak did not decrease, they deduced that the pipe ruptured somewhere between the lid of the tank and the delivery armature, where there is a special steel profile..

The site of the explosion was a storage tank, the purpose of which is a safety drainage of supporting medium from the production line. The storage tank contains two phases - acidic (that means sulphuric acid in the concentration of 70-80 %) and organic (nitrobenzene). Both phases normally contain dissolved nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene in concentrations of up to hundreds of mg/kg. The investigation found that the most probable course of events was as follows: The first factor was the climatic conditions, which lead to the freezing of the route of the waste condensate from the technological steam heating, followed by the penetration of the condensate from the overfilled condenser through the barometric closure into the drainage storage tank with the sulphuric acid. Here, as a consequence of the dissolving temperature on the interface of the acid and organic phase, the temperature gradually increased accompanied by other bypassing exothermic reactions (thermal decomposition of less stable nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene). These reactions increased the temperature on the interface up to the decomposition temperature of nitrobenzene. Thermal decomposition of nitrobenzene was accompanied by a rupture of the storage tank - explosion. An investigation team was appointed in accordance with the operational guidelines of BC MCHZ - Instruction M2 - 26150.doc ""Investigation of extraordinary events"". Results of the investigation are summarized in the report ""Accident of the adiabetic line of the production plant of nitrobenzene"" event.No.1/2003/VS3 from 27.1.2003. Following the comments to A1.Immediately after the explosion, the JHZS BC MCHZ arrived on the scene, followed by other components of IZS. At the same time, the instruction was issued to close the terminal of the rain collector that drains the water to the Odra (remote controlled armature). Information from other interested persons, including technical steps, followed in accordance with the internal emergency plan of BC MCHZ. The explosion of the storage tank in the bottom part of the steel panel construction of the adiabatic line caused damage to the technological constructions of the line in the floors above. There was no fire during the explosion and nobody was injured. The liquid content of the storage tank, partially also in the form of explosion products, was sent flying and most of the liquid phase landed in the retention tank under the line, while a small part fell on the consolidated road, and approx. 1m3 fell on the surrounding snow. The liquid phase froze on the road and snow, and it was possible to clean it up after mixing with sawdust. The contaminated material was deposited on a protected surface in the area BC MCHZ. At the same time an aerosol cloud composed from soot and fine drops of acids formed. Most of the aerosol sedimented in the inner part of the area, while a part was blown to the south and southwest of the plant. The aerosol also hit a high-tension cable- inlet insulators to BC MCHZ, and made them scintillate. They had to be cleaned, leading to a temporary cut in the supply of electricity. Debris was spread up to 90m with one piece (a tube) being found at a distance of 300 m - on the opposite bank of the Odra river.

Results of the investigation are summarized in the report ""Accident of the adiabetic line of the production plant of nitrobenzene"" event.No.1/2003/VS3 from 27.1.2003. Following the comments to A1.Immediately after the explosion, the JHZS BC MCHZ arrived on the scene, followed by other components of IZS. At the same time, the instruction was issued to close the terminal of the rain collector that drains the water to the Odra (remote controlled armature). Information from other interested persons, including technical steps, followed in accordance with the internal emergency plan of BC MCHZ. The explosion of the storage tank in the bottom part of the steel panel construction of the adiabatic line caused damage to the technological constructions of the line in the floors above. There was no fire during the explosion and nobody was injured. The liquid content of the storage tank, partially also in the form of explosion products, was sent flying and most of the liquid phase landed in the retention tank under the line, while a small part fell on the consolidated road, and approx. 1m3 fell on the surrounding snow. The liquid phase froze on the road and snow, and it was possible to clean it up after mixing with sawdust. The contaminated material was deposited on a protected surface in the area BC MCHZ. At the same time an aerosol cloud composed from soot and fine drops of acids formed. Most of the aerosol sedimented in the inner part of the area, while a part was blown to the south and southwest of the plant. The aerosol also hit a high-tension cable- inlet insulators to BC MCHZ, and made them scintillate. They had to be cleaned, leading to a temporary cut in the supply of electricity. Debris was spread up to 90m with one piece (a tube) being found at a distance of 300 m - on the opposite bank of the Odra river. The pressure wave broke windows in the surroundings and damaged the guttering of roofs of the neighbouring objects.",incident type > explosion > vapor explosion,46.0,2,incident type > explosion > Other (depth-capped)

During the morning of Friday 25 September 1998, a pump supplying heated lean oil to heat exchanger GP905 in Gas Plant No. 1 went offline for four hours, due to an increase in flow from the Marlin Gas Field which caused an overflow of condensate in the absorber. (The plant was complex and the hot oil pump was only one component involved in the accident process; why the pump shutdown is complicated and important.) A heat exchanger is a vessel that allows the transfer of heat from a hot stream to a cold stream, and so does not operate at a single temperature, but experiences a range of temperatures throughout the vessel. Temperatures throughout GP905 normally ranged from 60 °C to 230 °C (140 °F to 446 °F). Investigators estimated that, due to the failure of the lean oil pump, parts of GP905 experienced temperatures as low as −48 °C (−54 °F). Ice had formed on the unit, and it was decided to resume pumping heated lean oil in to thaw it. When the lean oil pump resumed operation, it pumped oil into the heat exchanger at 230 °C (446 °F)—the temperature differential caused a brittle fracture in the exchanger (GP905) at 12.26pm. About 10 metric tonnes of hydrocarbon vapour were immediately vented from the rupture. A vapour cloud formed and drifted downwind. When it reached a set of heaters 170 metres away, it ignited. This caused a deflagration (a burning vapour cloud). The flame front burnt its way through the vapour cloud, without causing an explosion. When the flamefront reached the rupture in the heat exchanger, a fierce jet fire developed that lasted for two days. The rupture of GP905 led to other releases and minor fires.

While the control room, high pressure pump and electric motor drive unit are located in separate containers, the cutting facility and water treatment facility are located in a building (tent) approximately 80 m away.The solid fuel consists mainly of ammonium perchlorate (69%), aluminium powder (18%) and additional substances (13%), including hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) (9%). Once washed out, the solid fuel is separated by a lock system and a conveyor and then manually placed in containers.The water used to wash out the solid propellant is collected and mechanically processed in, inter alia, a tilted plate interceptor, a metal-edge filter, a candle filter and three storage tanks. It remains in the process circuit and is returned to a high pressure pump via another container. The washing-out process takes place under secure conditions. At around 2:10, an external staff member noticed smoke on the monitor of the ‘tent interior’ camera and informed the shift manager, who intended to carry out an on-site inspection. However, it quickly became clear that a large-scale fire had broken out in the building (tent).At 2:21 the ‘tent interior’ camera cut out.At 2:25 the external staff member made an emergency call to the fire brigade.

The fire brigade’s investigation revealed that this was a DN 50 pipeline containing trichlorosilane.The pipeline was decompressed and shut off by the supplier. Due to the length of the pipe bridge and the distances between the shut-off valves, a large residual volume remained in the piping.Loudspeaker announcements were immediately made in parts of the plant instructing people not to leave or enter buildings (gas alarm).Measurements from the measurement bus, which was immediately deployed, showed no elevated values, neither for hydrogen chloride nor for other substances. The fire brigade used turbo extinguishers to precipitate the gas cloud; this was very successful. However, the gas alarm was maintained as a precaution until the fire brigade had given its final report back on the closed-off pipeline.

This pipe is part of the high-pressure section of the urea plant, but no urea flows through it when the system is operating normally (dead branch). The incident was caused by a corrosion mechanism which, due to the prevailing temperature gradient, led to an unexpectedly high degree of abrasion. It should be noted here that, in the context of work carried out while the system was out of operation in 2010, the main pipe was pressure-tested with 1.3 times the system pressure and the wall thickness was measured, with no abnormalities being detected in either case. The system was isolated and the pressure reduced using valves and water walls were created by the on-site fire service to precipitate the ammonia.

This led to the tank being filled to 93&nbsp;% and filling was therefore stopped above the level of the overfill warning alarm.The interface is usually stored in three tanks. This is managed from the control room in Cologne-Godorf on the basis of an online, up-to-date fluid level measurement that is continuously monitored by the measuring station at GTL Flörsheim.There are generally two members of staff (dispatchers) at the pipeline measuring station, who can stand in for each other to control the plant, in particular the filling of tanks. Owing to the ongoing repair work, since the end of 2014 one tank – and therefore around one third of the storage capacity for the interface – has been unavailable.For operational reasons relating to the pipeline, on 3&nbsp;March 2015 the interface was unusually large, so that it was unclear whether the available tank capacity would be sufficient to store the sales product at the expected high standards. In order to test the options for storage in the finished product tank without an adverse impact on quality, the dispatchers fetched the pipeline quality manager while the filling was still underway. Distracted by the discussion, they heard neither warning signals from the system nor a telephone call from the measuring station at Flörsheim and consequently did not act on them.The overfill alarm (changeover point – tank level measurement) was activated at 14:38:14 and set off acoustic and optical alarms in the pipeline measuring station. Just 36 seconds later, the HHH alarm (independent overfill protection device within the meaning of the VAwS Ordinance on installations handling substances which constitute a hazard to water) was activated, which in turn activated the automatic emergency shutdown of filling by:&nbsp; – closing the quick-closing valve on the pipeline (~6 seconds);– closing the motor tank valve on the bulk storage tank (~40 seconds);– shutting down the pipeline pumps by remote control. At the same time, the HH alarm for the tank level measurement was reached and also activated an emergency shutdown by cancelling clearance for filling.The available tank volumes were sufficient to safely prevent the tank from being overfilled. The overfill alarm on the tank cut off the fill signal for the pipeline and thus led to the emergency shutdown of the pipeline pump and the closure of the quick-closing valve on the pipeline. At the same time, the motorised valve on the tank was closed.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

Furthermore, the compressed air added via the nozzle ring installed at the base of the tank was increased to over 3&nbsp;m3/h. These measures guaranteed specific maximum temperatures throughout the entire incident.In the lower and middle parts of the tank, the acrylamide solution remained in a liquid state, while in the upper part, for the most part a solid polymer developed.

This manual transfer was being done using the force of gravity, with the liquid running from the IBC, which had been lifted using a forklift truck, via an attached funnel into the barrel. The transfer was taking place fairly centrally on the ground floor of the production building. On the explosion zone (ex-zone) plan, this point was marked as ‘ex-filling’.According to the work instruction, a barrel pump should be used and the IBC should be earthed. During transfer, the IBC, which had been lifted on a forklift truck, was positioned over the ‘ex-filling’ zone’s collecting basin. According to statements from experts and the property insurer, for reasons that are not completely clear, the flammable vapour/air mixture was ignited by an electrostatic discharge, resulting in a fire.

The contents of the document remained known only to them. The document contained the pumping flow rate (ca. 500 m#/h), the volume of water to be purged (2900m#), the time estimated for purging the pipeline (ca. 6h), the frequency of supervisions of the system (in the first three hours not less than three times an hour; starting from the fourth hour continuous monitoring until conclusion of the purging), the circumstances for which the sewage treatment plant of the refinery would have to be contacted as well as the conditions under which the pumping operations would have to be stopped.On 14/10/98 at about 20:30 h the deputy captain of the ship Enalios Tethis signed a discharge protocol, named ""Operation Agreement &amp; Sequence Agreement"", according to the parameters agreed upon with the Product Handling department, without making any reservation from the part of the tanker concerning the assurance of minimal flow-rate of 500 m#/h .Once the unloading started, the CLT informed the Product Handling control room that according to the information given by the ship, the pumping flow-rate corresponded to 300 m#/h.The assistant manager of the Logistics department requested around 21:05 from- CLT an increase of the flow rate to 500 m#/h. He again requested the control room to confirm jointly with the CLT the flow rate, because the level in the channel was already reaching half level.Around 21:15 the manager of the Product Handling Department communicated to the operator of the waste water treatment plant that the water which was being purged was clean, so that drain 25 (rainwater) could be diverted from the storm-water basin to the sea, an operation which was performed.Around 21:20 the ship informed CLT that pumping was being carried out with a flow rate of 500m#/h , information which was transmitted to the control room of the Product Handling department.Around 21:40 the assistant manager of the Logistics department requested an increase of the pumping flow rate of further 100 m3/h, having observed that in the purging zone (zona di spurgo) the water remained clean and that the level in the channel had increased to near to reach its maximum level; he also requested the CLT to confirm the flow rate. Around 21:45 the deputy captain of the ship informed that the pumping was being carried out at a flow rate of 650 m#/h. After having established that the channel could not contain a higher flow rate, the assistant manager of the logistics department requested not to increase the flow rate any more and, in case of any variation, to reduce it. Instructions were issued to the ship not to exceed a flow rate of 700 m#/h.During shift change at 22:00, the operation coordinator was informed about the situation and it was particularly recommended to him that ""if traces of oil appeared, to request U 7000 (on-site waste water treatment plant) to divert drain 25 to the storm water basins, and after 24:00 to divert the drain to the storm water basin in any case even if no oil spot appeared"".The operator of the waste water treatment plant declared that at 22:30 he saw traces of hydrocarbons in the water flowing in the outlet box of drain 25 towards the rainwater drain; he then went to the storm water basins to ascertain the situation. Around 22:40, he alerted by phone the control room of the Product Handling department and started the operations for diverting drain 25 from the rain water drain to the storm water basin of the waste water treatment plant. Meanwhile, the operator of the Security Service passing near the control room was requested to check what was occurring in drain 25.At 22:45 the release of crude oil by drainage system 25 occurred.In consideration of this situation, it was ordered to divert drain 25 towards the storm water basin and to contact CLT to stop the pumping from the ship.At approx. 22:50 the operator of the waste water treatment plant performed the diverting operation of drain 25 from the rain water drain towards then storm water basins, but due to the high flow rate a part of the effluent was still discharged to the sea. It has not been determined if the operator acted following a specific order from the control room of the Product Handling department or if he acted on his own independent initiative. The operator declared that he acted on his own initiative. The Product Handling department declared on its side that a specific request had been issued.Around 23:05, the Product Handling department requested CLT to interrupt the pumping, which was carried out. The Product Handling department informed CLT that the deputy captain had communicated that until 23:00 2900 m3 had been discharged.Around 23:15 general alarm was released while the fire which had deflagrated on the beach of Aterro propagated through the rain water outfall to the rain water outlet box inside, the refinery .The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

Two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The release occurred because the pH value of the solution was too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. The two workers were killed. The initial concentration of the released gas was at least 1000 ppm. 1999, the initiating event was the addition of solid phase sodium sulphide to liquid phase spent pickling solutions, which had far too low a pH value. The intention was to precipitate heavy metals in the solution. However, the very low pH value induced formation of hydrogen sulphide gas rather than precipitation of heavy metals.[TEXT 1] On the afternoon of the 9th of may 1995, there was a release of hydrogen sulphide gas at a plant, which resulted in the death of two process workers. The release occurred at a plant for the production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solutions. The two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The pH value of the pickling solution was much too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. Therefore instead of the expected chemical reaction (precipitation) an unexpected reaction (formation of hydrogen sulphide gas) occurred.

The entire contents of the cistern was spilled out into the tank bund and then out into Kemira Kemi AB's (KKAB) dock. When the sulphuric acid came into contact with the water there was an exothermic reaction, which produced a vapour cloud that drifted northwards along the coastline with the wind. After the spill there was approximately 2,000 tons of contaminated sulphuric acid by water in the bund. About 100,000 sq.m. of the ground surrounding the spill has been affected by the acid. An acid cloud was produced when the sulphuric acid came into contact with the salt water in the bund. The salt water consisted of approx. 0.7 w-% chloride ions. The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) has estimated that the sulphuric acid together with the salt water produced a cloud (gas and aerosol) consisting of hydrogen chloride (HCl). During the first few minutes the maximum concentration of HCl was estimated at 6 000 mg/m3 at some spots near the scene of the accident.&nbsp; After 10 min the highest concentration was 600 mg/m3 and the concentration declined to 60 mg/m3 after 60 min. Fortunately the cloud moved along the coast line and mostly over the sea. No one outside the plant was affected.The cistern stands in a tank farm and the bund can hold a third of a cistern's volume in the event of a leak. The bund was filled with salt water when the rupture occurred. There was also another cistern containing 19,500 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid in the bund. To reduce the risk of damage to this other cistern the incident commander ordered the emptying of the bund, resulting in 1,000 to 2,000 tons of water contaminated by sulphuric acid being pumped out into the company's dock area.Meteorological conditions:The acid cloud (gas and aerosol)&nbsp; moved along the coastline but mostly over the sea.

The accident case history was as followed:- 03:20 Production stopped.- 04:00 Clearing of tank V-2500 (see diagram No 2 attached to the Original Report) from liquid chlorine (pumped into buffer tanks).- 04:30 The remaining liquid chlorine in the heater section was (supposed to be) released to tank V-2504 (see diagram No 2). After the accident it was concluded that this step must have been executed in a too short period of time and only a partial boil-off of liquid chlorine resulted. So this section was still containing some liquid chlorine which was heated to about 80°C.- 04:45 An attempt was made to free the heater section E-2504 (see diagram No 2) from (residual) chlorine by the introduction of pressurized air. The presence of a one-way valve may not have been recognized (see diagram No 2). It resulted in chlorine inlet into the process air system. Process air system (7 bara) was responsible for chlorine distribution and emission in about 12 different sites on the plant. Therefore, chlorine emission occurred via several in- and outdoors sources.- 04:55 Chlorine detectors (limited to shipping and compression areas) intervened (chlorine concentrations up to 0.8 ppm during the accident) resulting in the automatic cut off of the equipment.- 05:00 The air supply to the heater was manually closed (although the cause of chlorine leakage was not known, possible chlorine sources were blocked in). After, the remaining contents of the heater section was fed to a chlorine destruction unit.- 05:25 Supervisor activated chlorine alarm (phase 0 according to the emergency plan: internal warning to personnel, external warning to local police).- 06:00 Shift change (the night-crew remained several hours until the situation became clear). Due to the specific (weather and emission) conditions, there was no significant dispersion.- 06:55 Supervisor activated chlorine alarm phase 1 (possible nuisance outside the plant).- 07:30 Several complaints from the neighbourhood (about 10) recorded. Local police activated alarm phase 2 (annoyance, no danger).- 07:45 Municipal fire brigade brought the alarm phase back to 1. At about 08:14 again to phase 0.- 08:30 All warnings were deleted by the safety division of AKZO plant.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

No reports have come in at CIN (Chemical Incident Network Line) between 13.40 and 13.56 hour. Therefore, directly or indirectly due to the complete power failure the TDF/Tiofine company was not able to inform the public services at once (exact information about this problem can not be retrieved any more). It took about 8 minutes to inform the Police Alarm Centre via the CIN. The chlorine went underneath the chlorine detection system which was located at the height of 3 metres. This may explain why the emission went unnoticed and why no gas alarm was given. Another factor of influence may have been that due to the power failure the system was not working anyway. Unfortunately it is not possible to retrieve the exact reason why the gas detection system did not function. As a result the company did not notice the emission at all.

Water contamination cannot be excluded.A fire started in the repackaging area. The fire jumped across to other storage rooms and eventually caused a mass explosion of the stored fireworks.The process of escalation that lead to the disaster started in the repackaging area C2. The cause of the initial fire in this area has not been clarified. Suggested causes are: arson, auto-ignition of a so-called flash-cord, short circuiting of an improvised electricity conduit in C2 or the (illegal) handling/using of fireworks on May 13. The fire was not noticed until external effects occurred. When the fire brigade arrived at the scene, the fire had probably been going on for at least 25 minutes. By that time several fires had started in the area, caused by ejected fireworks. At a certain point in time, a fire started in a triangle between two containers and the concrete fencing of the site. Even after the fire in C2 was brought under control, smoke and later flames and ignited fireworks were detected from the adjacent bunker C4. A suggested scenario how the fire spread to this bunker is that it passed through the 7 centimeter diameter water-pipe lead-through in the wall between C2 and C4. Consequently, the fire brigade detected the fire in the triangle between the two containers (E2 and E15) and the concrete fence. Attempts to extinguish this fire were complicated by the inaccessability of the triangle. At this moment the fire had probably already spread to the contents of container E2. This may be concluded from the fact that shortly after the fire brigade had started extinguishing the fire in the triangle, they observed signs of fire in container E2. Shortly afterwards, container E2 exploded. This explosion caused a large flame in the direction of the central storage. However, this has probably not been the main factor in the following escalation. Ejected heavy fireworks from E2 exploded in front of the MAVO boxes, probably struck through the doors of these boxes and ignited its contents. Within one minute after the explosion of container E2, the MAVO boxes exploded rapidly one by one, starting with M7. This mass explosion is probably mainly due to the heavy class of the fireworks, in combination with the small dampening between the MAVO boxes. M7 probably contained fireworks of class 1.1. Its explosion had a TNT equivalent of circa 800 kg and was accompanied by a shock wave and a fire ball of 85 meters in diameter. Little more than a minute after the explosion of the MAVO boxes the final explosion took place, destroying bunker C11 and the rest of the bunker complex. The remaining containers exploded almost simultaneously. It is assumed that the ejected fireworks from the explosion of the MAVO boxes and/or the fireball initiated the explosion in C11. The doors of the bunkers had probably been destroyed by the previous explosion. The explosion of the other bunkers of the central storage was either initiated by ejected fireworks, or by the heat from the explosion in C11. The time interval between the explosions of the separate bunkers was so small that they were perceived as one. This final explosion had a TNT-equivalent of about 4 to 5 tonnes.",firework,2.0,3,firework

Investigation showed that the tank wall was 'flattened' presumably because of wind. A large amount of water on the roof (as was noticed shortly before the incident) which was not considered reason for corrective action in combination with the 'flattened' wall may have caused the roof to get stuck to the tank wall during filling.

On the day of the accident the dispersion feeding pipe was blocked by solidified lithium metal. To unblock the pipe, a wooden stick was used to push (to avoid sparks and any damage to the reactor's enamel). After removal of a blind flange, the valve on the cleaning nipple was filled with paraffin (prior the reactor and the connected piping were depressurized). The wooden stick used for pushing was wrapped with a piece of cloth soaked in paraffin and the piece of cloth was put over the opened valve in such a way that the reactor should be protected against air entry. As the blockage was unusually solid, it could not be removed by pushing. During the attempt to remove the solidified lithium, the lithium dispersion was released through the ring slot between the wooden stick and the cleaning valve and seeped under the paraffinated piece of cloth on the reactor and ignited spontaneously. The worker on the operation platform above the reactor was burned on nose and neck by the jet-fire; the worker in front of the reactor was not hurt. Both workers run quickly to the control room and activated the alarm as they were not able to avoid the spreading fire on a second platform. The first fire was fed by the continuing release of lithium/diehtylether dispersion (it has been estimated that about 700 litres of lithium/diethylether were released). Due to the strong evolution of heat, synthetic materials caught fire: cables, lamp covers, a light globe and finally the tar board cover of the beton roof. The sudden unexpected release of the lithium dispersion from the cleaning valve can be explained as a manipulation error. The inlet valve in the reactor as well as the lateral outlet valve from the dispersion tank were not closed from the beginning of this otherwise routine executed cleaning operation. As the wooden stick was in the cleaning valve it was impossible to close this valve.",lithium,1.0,3,lithium

As for this were given and mixed methanol and orthonitrochlorobenzene, the mixer was shut down and nitrogen impressed. Then, without the stirring apparatus again connected (operational error). the reactor was heated at the pre-established temperature and was pumped in the reactor the pre-established quantity of methanolic caustic soda. After waiting of the prescribed reaction time was observed that the stirring apparatus did not run. The apparatus controller switched it in. Then the running exothermic reaction became very strong accelerated, with a temperature rise from 95 to 115 degrees Celsius. The reactor pressure rose from 9 to 16 bar. The safety valves opened. About 40% of the reaction mixture (10t) were out pounded through 2 valves. During the transformation of in the reaction kettle originate normally ortho-nitroanisole, common salt and water. During the perturbance the mixture, due to the incomplete reaction and to the strong over heating, changed itself in a way that resulted other chemical connections, that during normal service don't occur, like dichlorazolbenzene and dichlorazoxibenzene.

As preparation of this operation the injection of cold ammonia on the tank head was interrupted and a refrigerant compressor was started.In the context of this operation at 11:05 h the tank drainage valve, used as intake, was completely opened while the valve on the other end of the drain pipe was opened to ¼. During this operation a worker was staying on a platform at 3 m height, whereas another worker was standing below the platform. Both workers were permanently in contact over radio with the control room.Both workers heard an unusual noise after opening the valve of the drainage pipe. The worker on the platform closed the drain valve of the tank a few seconds after and left the platform over an access ladder. The control room operator noticed approximately at the same time a rapid pressure increase in the tank. In that moment (11:10) a loud bang occurred with the sudden release of ammonia gas which dispersed around against the wind. One worker could escape across to the wind. At some&nbsp; 30 m away he noticed the absence of his colleague. He immediately went towards the leak-point, finding his colleague lying on the ground injured and evidently unable to escape by himself. Nevertheless he was able to drag the victim out of the direct danger area. The victim suffered direct injuries and serious damage to the respiratory tractAnd skin burns due to ammonia.At 11:11 h another collaborator who noticed clearly the bang and ammonia release alerted the fire brigade. The fire brigade arrived at 11:23 h. At 11:37 first aid medical treatment was started.When the first ammonia release ended a leak appeared near the drain outlet at the bottom of the tank, more than 10m3/h of ammonia water were released an formed a pool in the retention pond.Ammonia evaporated from the pool and formed a visible mist which spread around at a speed of 7 m/s.During the following 4 to 6 hours two other leaks formed on the tank, located respectively approx. 90° to the drain outlet. At approx. 15:00 the fire brigade installed basins to catch leaking ammonia water, a vacuum pumping vehicle transferred the ammonia water into a storage tank which had been prepared meanwhile. From 17:00 h on the&nbsp; release rate reduced constantly, such that it was possible from 20:00 on to start pumping the pool of ammonia water from the retention pond. At about 22:00 the leak rate in the first leak was reduced at an almost not perceivable level, ammonia was still leaking only from the later formed leak points.At about 13:00 h the day after, approx 26 hours later, there were only minimal amounts of ammonia released from the three leak points. The last rests of ammonia water from the retention pool pond and from the drain pits was continued until 06.01.2005.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

The accident caused an explosive fire, which was extinguished within half an hour. The accident took the lives of three peoples.&nbsp; No-one was injured. The melt shop was in an annual maintenance shutdown and control work was being done on valves on the oxygen distribution pipeline. Main pipeline runs from the exterior of the building to the melt shop. The back-pressure valves had been changed and the testing of the system was starting up. The accident investigation has been carried out by the national Accident Investigation Board and TUKES. Accident Case HistoryA fierce fire costing the lives of three workers took place at the Tornio (Finland) steelworks of AvestaPolarit Stainless Oy on September 19, 2003. The accident site was the melting shop of the steelworks. The melting shop line number 2 that had been built the previous year was in its first annual maintenance shutdown. During the shutdown back pressure valves were to be installed to pipelines conveying the so called raw oxygen and pure oxygen. Therefore they had been closed and made purged by air. Most of the work had already been completed, and the foreman of the factory and the foreman of the subcontractor started preparing thestart-up of the oxygen systems.The men entered the valve room on the third floor of the melting house, where they successfully opened the main shut valve of the raw oxygen line. Thereafter they started opening the main shut valve of the oxygen line. The valve was apparently stuck, because the bolt pin holding the hand wheel in the valve stem snapped. The men asked for pipe tongs, with the help of which they started turning the valve hand wheel stem. They managed to turn the stem about one turn, corresponding to a 9° turn of the disc. At that moment an explosive fire broke out. It kept burning fiercely as the oxygen was leaking from the damaged piping. Both the foremen that had been opening the valve and a welder who had come to the scene by chance were killed.Judging by the burn marks the fire started from the oxygen line main shut valve; a butterfly valve with a nominal diameter of 300 mm. Gaseous oxygen compressed to a pressure of 35 bar was flowing in the pipes. There was a by-pass line beside the valve. Due to safety reasons this line was supposed to be used to equalize the pressure on both sides of the main shut valve before opening the latter. After the accident the by-pass valve was found to be in a closed position, although no specific information about the use of the by-pass line was found in the investigation. Whether or not the by-pass line was used will have affected the cause of the fire.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

The accident investigation has been carried out by the national Accident Investigation Board and TUKES. Accident Case HistoryA fierce fire costing the lives of three workers took place at the Tornio (Finland) steelworks of AvestaPolarit Stainless Oy on September 19, 2003. The accident site was the melting shop of the steelworks. The melting shop line number 2 that had been built the previous year was in its first annual maintenance shutdown. During the shutdown back pressure valves were to be installed to pipelines conveying the so called raw oxygen and pure oxygen. Therefore they had been closed and made purged by air. Most of the work had already been completed, and the foreman of the factory and the foreman of the subcontractor started preparing thestart-up of the oxygen systems.The men entered the valve room on the third floor of the melting house, where they successfully opened the main shut valve of the raw oxygen line. Thereafter they started opening the main shut valve of the oxygen line. The valve was apparently stuck, because the bolt pin holding the hand wheel in the valve stem snapped. The men asked for pipe tongs, with the help of which they started turning the valve hand wheel stem. They managed to turn the stem about one turn, corresponding to a 9° turn of the disc. At that moment an explosive fire broke out. It kept burning fiercely as the oxygen was leaking from the damaged piping. Both the foremen that had been opening the valve and a welder who had come to the scene by chance were killed.Judging by the burn marks the fire started from the oxygen line main shut valve; a butterfly valve with a nominal diameter of 300 mm. Gaseous oxygen compressed to a pressure of 35 bar was flowing in the pipes. There was a by-pass line beside the valve. Due to safety reasons this line was supposed to be used to equalize the pressure on both sides of the main shut valve before opening the latter. After the accident the by-pass valve was found to be in a closed position, although no specific information about the use of the by-pass line was found in the investigation. Whether or not the by-pass line was used will have affected the cause of the fire.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION: During a storm at the end of the working period (most employees had already left the plant), two very powerful, successive explosions occurred in less than 5 seconds in the fusion cavity of the furnace, causing extensive damages to the foundations of the furnace. The first explosion, undoubtedly in the form of a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT, fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later. The first explosion could have generated a pressure of 10 to 20 bar on the sides of the pit, and the generated seismic wave was recorded by several seismographs in the region and furnished an energy undoubtedly at least 1,000 times greater than that of the electric arc produced in the building.An inquiry commission was rapidly formed after the accident and worked in close contact with and under the supervision of administrative and judicial authorities. It made use of the services of experts in the following fields: explosions, use of natural gas, prevention, meteorology and storms, metallurgy, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, combustible dust. The analysis of statements and interviews indicated that a luminous phenomenon in the foundry, followed, almost immediately, by the first explosion and 2 seconds later by a second explosion. The examination of material in the foundry shop near the presumed starting point of the explosion showed that the motor of a mobile hoist located 15 metres from the supposed point of explosion presented indisputable traces of the passage of lightning-related current. In addition, it was possible to determine numerous possibilities for the routing of the current leading to the starting point of the explosion. In particular, the casting pit itself, where the explosion started, was the best grounding point in proximity to the motor. It was supposed that the molten aluminium alloy could have led to: either an explosion of aluminium alloy droplets dispersed in air (which involves a suspension process) or a reaction of molten aluminium with water. The first was opted for. The molten aluminium was suspended in air by the action of the shock wave produced by the electric arc. The shock wave dispersed 150-300 kg (of a total of 1,200 kg) of molten aluminium alloy around the casting frame in the form of a fog of fine droplets. Only a part of the energy of the shock wave was used in this dispersion process. The fog then exploded (as a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT) as a result of the droplets/air reaction. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two seconds later, as a result of the rapid vaporization of cooling water in contact with the molten metal, which fell from the upper part of the casting pit. The first explosion fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later.

Even if the foundry was equipped with natural gas piping for heating the furnaces, the hypothesis of the formation of a flammable mixture with air was excluded because of: the large volume of the flammable mixture necessary to explain the magnitude of the damages (no major leak was noted), the fact that the mixture would have accumulated in the upper part of the building (whereas damaged were on the ground) and the absence of heat effects resulting from a gas explosion.",incident type > explosion > physical explosion,18.0,3,incident type > explosion > physical explosion

At 13:40 the traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. On-site there were 8 doctors, 5 ambulances and 2 re-animation vehicles. 18 beds for injured people were available. At 13:55, 117 policemen were present (200 at 14:20). At 14:10 the cooling of tanks (about 2,000m3/h by means of 25 monitors) was activated (it was carried out until the fire was extinguished). At 14:30, 200 policemen, 150 firemen, 20 doctors and nurses were present on-site. At 14:45, the Particular Emergency Plan was activated and the organization of emergency was under the direct control of the local Prefect. At 17:00 the fire spread all over the depot despite the water cooling. At 17:25 a first attempt to extinguishing the fire was carried out by means of 9 guns using 100,000 litres of foam. At 18:32 the explosion of another tank occurred and 6 firemen were wounded. The fire extended. The medical staff was reinforced. The explosion was due to boil-over of a tank containing 1,000 m3 of gasoil which created a fire-ball nearly 450m high and 200m wide. The fire spread to to the neighbouring storage area and to various buildings inside the installation. At that time, about 72,000 litres of foam were used.

More precisely, the addition of a new product to the silicon oil caused a release of hydrogen, and perhaps also sodium hydride, due to a wrong pH control (this reaction, when was experimentally performed in a laboratory, caused a deflagration). The worker who performed the defective operation was alone in the plant. Seriously burned, he had been found many tens of metres from the point where the explosion occurred; it is unknown however if he was displaced by the explosion or if he was transported there by other people or if he had escaped before the explosion. A call for help was received at 03:07 by the centre of alert transmission of Tours and it was re-trasmitted to the centres of Chateau-Renault and Amboise. At 03:20 a fire fighting vehicle from Chateau-Renault arrived on-site. Since the accident led to the rupture of three fire hydrants, two lances were installed taking water from the Brenne river, 500 metres away. At 03:40 the fire fighting vehicle from Amboise arrived and at 04:06 4 lances were in operation. Meanwhile, the fire covered a surface of about 2,000-3,000 m2. At 05:52 two foam guns arrived from Tours and, when at 06:15, 2 foam tankers arrived on-site, they were put in operation with positive effects due to the synthetic foam used. Owing to the formation of a toxic cloud inside the building, at about 05:00 the Mayor of Chateau-Renault decided to evacuate a building where 200 handicapped people were housed. From 05:00 to 08:30 analyses of the cloud composition have been performed every half an hour. Those analyses revealed the presence of hydrogen cyanide, carbon oxide, nitrogen oxides and halogens. At 08:30 the analysis revealed only some traces of carbon oxide. There was the risk of intoxication for the rescuers (because they had no suitable personnel protection equipment) and also a risk of explosion of nearby reactors and vessels. The water used to cool these vessels and to extinguish the fire (500-600m3/h) caused the pollution of the Brenne river crossing the site. A dike was built a few hours after the fire started to prevent discharge of used fire fighting water to this river. Despite these measures, phenols were found in Loire river fed by the Brenne river. The authorities decided to interrupt (for three days) the distribution of drinking water to 200,000 people. Drinking water needs were estimated to be 45,000m3/day and were covered by various sources (interconnection with water networks of nearby communities, the use of water sources not affected by the pollution, the use of deep wells, extended the use of bottled mineral water and the use of two trains of 3,000 m3 capacity each).",incident type > explosion > chemical explosion,184.0,3,incident type > explosion > chemical explosion

The underground pipes were feeding eleven tanks in different conditions (empty but not degassified, half empty, full, empty and degassified, empty). Maintenance work started on June 11 (hot work-permit had been ordinarily issued on June 10 and the pipes were empty). When the fire started, the water emulsion in the tank basins became yellow and ignited resulting in fire. The alarm was sounded and all valves were automatically closed (it required about 14 minutes). Soon after, the power supply was also interrupted.

Instead, the phenomenon repeated various times that afternoon and the flames were extinguished by the personnel quickly. There was an unsuccessful attempt to extinguish the fire by covering the inspection pit with sand. The fire escalated but the personnel in collaboration with the fire brigade managed to confine it within the tank dike by applying foam using foam monitors. At about 15:20 an explosion occurred and, even if all people thought it was tank No 76, the explosion was caused by two acetylene bottles used in the maintenance works.

The temperature was monitored at different points of the distillation unit, and the temperature control was assured by regulating manually both the gas flow to the burners and the draught. The essential maintenance task was to absorb zinc oxides releases which occurred relatively frequently between the trays, fouling the installation.&nbsp; The cleaning operation was performed through inspection openings on the walls of the heating chamber, which were closed during operation with refractory plugs and sealed with clay. This operation was performed by refractory bricklayers employed by the company or by a specialised subcontractor. Independently, the columns were operated permanently during 18 months.

The accident is therefore notified only for this reason, since the criteria of Annex VI are not fulfilled. The accident is classified at level 0 of the gravity scale, based on the available information.The accident:The accident occurred on the HCN production installations, at the level of a mist separator placed on the residual gas transfer line between the head of the HCN absorption tower and the CNIM boiler.Several incidents had occurred during the previous days:- Problems in extracting liquids at the base of the HCN purification tower (tower H2243) from March 20 to 26 made it necessary to use a second pump. On March 27th, the decision was taken to shutdown the distillation train to clean the HCN polymers that had formed.The shut-down procedure foresaw:&nbsp;- draining the HCN from the train, up to 2% HCN in the drainage water, by directing it toward the ADN unit,- performing air stripping until an HCN concentration is reached which allows the equipment to be opened, the residual gases being burned in the CNIM boiler.On March 28 and 29, the distillation train was drained (shut-down of the HCN converters, as well as the natural gas heaters and the upstream TGN). Draining remained difficult due to extraction problems at the base of tower H2243. On March 29th at 13:00, the decision was taken to switch over to the air stripping phase.The concentration of 1.2% HCN in the towers, measured at the base of tower H2242, was higher than the usual values although it was below the threshold value of 5% tolerated during the operating mode.In compliance with the safety procedures, the workshop was evacuated on March 29th at 16:15 p.m. before the stripping operation was launched. The order to evacuate was cancelled 15 minutes later and 9 people returned to the workshop.The explosion occurred at 16:40 at the level of the mist separator H1191 located at 5 m height on the gas line.The two nearest analysers (Toxguard) located at a distance of 10 and 15 m indicated 30 ppm of HCN; the concentration values dropped after 5 minutes. Other equipment located 100 m from the unit sporadically detected values in the order of 4 to 5 ppm of HCN.The shop personnel were evacuated to a withdrawal zone and the stripping operation was shut down immediately. At 16:45 the unit's Toxguard detector detected a HCN concentration higher than 5 ppm and triggered alarm, the 300 people present in the establishment were ordered to shelter. The on-site emergency plan was put into operation at the same time and the on-site fire-brigade intervened with SCBA (self contained breathing apparatus). Water curtains were set up around the installations.HCN concentrations measured outside the workshop were below 2ppm.The header line of the HCN absorption tower was isolated from tower H2241 at 17:30. Only the Toxguard near the separator unit still indicated a concentration of 15 ppm of HCN 30 min later.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

The site does not fall within the scope of the Seveso Directive.The accident: A violent explosion occurred in correspondence with the handling tower.The accident is classified at level 2 of the accident gravity scale due to the fact that one employee died as a result of the explosion.This kind of accident is unfortunately not an exceptional event. The accident is notified with the objective of ensuring that this kind of situation is better known and taken more into consideration.The accidentAt 10:00 h on 14th May 2001 a truck arrived at the plant to deliver 29 t of colza press cakes. The driver started unloading operations in the receiving pit of the brick silo (storage hangar).At the same time two workers started working on the delivery redler conveyor of the brick silo, trying to repair the scraper driving chain. The repair operation consisted in cutting the chain and welding some links after removing the redler conveyor cover on the side facing the pit.A violent explosion occurred at 11:15 h.The truck driver who was near the discharging platform was slightly burned. The two workers in the pit were seriously injured (3rd degree burns). One worker managed to get out of the pit on his own. He activated the emergency shut-down switch of the handling tower. His colleagues made him sit on a chair while waiting for the emergency response service. The emergency response service arrived approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The other worker was lying unconscious in the pit. He was brought out after 1/2 hour by the fire brigade.The explosion was heard in the neighbourhood and was followed by a fire in the pit, in the hopper and in the areas of the tower and the gallery above the cells.The hot gases and/or incandescent particles ignited the dust deposits in the air circulation system of the cylindrical silos located a few meters away but a few meters above the horizontal silos. The fire fighters were alerted by the smoke plumes and intervened rapidly to fight the fire, thus avoiding the propagation of the fire to the vertical cylindrical storage cells.The explosion blew over half the roofing of the structure away and tore the walls of the tower open.

The installation was built in 1989. The raw materials are stored in silos before grinding and mixing operations. The finished product is then sent in bulk or in bags.The site is classified with an authorisation, issued with prefectoral order of 19th June 1989, mainly for grinding vegetable substances. The site does not fall within the scope of the Seveso Directive.The accident: A violent explosion occurred in correspondence with the handling tower.The accident is classified at level 2 of the accident gravity scale due to the fact that one employee died as a result of the explosion.This kind of accident is unfortunately not an exceptional event. The accident is notified with the objective of ensuring that this kind of situation is better known and taken more into consideration.The accidentAt 10:00 h on 14th May 2001 a truck arrived at the plant to deliver 29 t of colza press cakes. The driver started unloading operations in the receiving pit of the brick silo (storage hangar).At the same time two workers started working on the delivery redler conveyor of the brick silo, trying to repair the scraper driving chain. The repair operation consisted in cutting the chain and welding some links after removing the redler conveyor cover on the side facing the pit.A violent explosion occurred at 11:15 h.The truck driver who was near the discharging platform was slightly burned. The two workers in the pit were seriously injured (3rd degree burns). One worker managed to get out of the pit on his own. He activated the emergency shut-down switch of the handling tower. His colleagues made him sit on a chair while waiting for the emergency response service. The emergency response service arrived approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The other worker was lying unconscious in the pit. He was brought out after 1/2 hour by the fire brigade.The explosion was heard in the neighbourhood and was followed by a fire in the pit, in the hopper and in the areas of the tower and the gallery above the cells.The hot gases and/or incandescent particles ignited the dust deposits in the air circulation system of the cylindrical silos located a few meters away but a few meters above the horizontal silos. The fire fighters were alerted by the smoke plumes and intervened rapidly to fight the fire, thus avoiding the propagation of the fire to the vertical cylindrical storage cells.The explosion blew over half the roofing of the structure away and tore the walls of the tower open. Pieces of fibro-cement roofing panels were found at 30 m distance and several metal rods of the staircase giving access to the vertical silos were severed.The descending duct of the bucket conveyor employed for the silage of the press cakes was ripped open over a length of 4 m at the bottom of the pit section as well as at 2/3 height of the tower.",incident type > explosion > physical explosion,18.0,2,incident type > explosion > Other (depth-capped)

An inspection was made by the operator on the ground and in all ducts over the whole route of the pipe in order to identify the leak. Assessed at about 20 m3, the leak was due to fissuring on 40 cm of a pipe within the boundaries of the Le Havre plant. After the faulty section had been replaced, the whole of the pipe was tested again and the facility returned to operation. Four days later, on Sunday 11 August 2002 at 8.05 p.m. a new leak occurred which the monitoring system at once detected. The nominal flow was then 440 m3/h (dilute sulphuric acid), at a pressure of 3.9 bars (these conditions are however lower than the maximum running conditions and lower still than the test conditions). The leak was located outside the Le Havre plant, in an underground part of the pipeline, close to where it runs under a railway line behind the LPG storage and filling centre. The leak was assessed at between 100 and 200 m3. In total, between 5 August and 11 August 2002, eight defects were found, six of them on the first two kilometres of pipe.

The intention was to then start the ""back end"" Vapour Recovery Unit (VRU or ""light ends"" section) (see Figure B) of the plant by progressively introducing hydrocarbons into each of the columns in turn.The main fractionator and absorber columns were successfully brought on line and then material was introduced into the Debutaniser column (E5) sometime after 01.00 a.m.At this stage the control room operator had difficulty in achieving the correct temperature and pressure at the base of the column E5 and this resulted in the relief valves lifting. Problems were also experienced in maintaining the correct levels in the next column downstream (the Re-run column E6) due to gas being present in the pump which controlled the liquid levels in the column. This was a common problem experienced during start up conditions.During start-up and before transferring liquids from E5 to E6, standard operating practice for plant operators is to dewater the transfer line using a number of drain points on the system. Dewatering is essential because if the water in E5 (which is operated at a high temperature and pressure relative to the conditions in the column E6) was transferred into E6 it would result in the water immediately ""flashing off"" to produce steam. The transition between liquid and vapour phases is accompanied by significant volumetric changes and this could potentially damage the Re-run column E6.In order to dewater the column a drain point at the base of the column E5 on the outlet pipework is opened and water is allowed to escape to the local ground drains until hydrocarbons are observed coming out. This operation is carried out several times prior to transfer commencing in order to ensure that all the water has been removed. The hydrocarbons discharged to the drain system are subsequently removed in the effluent treatment systems for the Complex and are not discharged off-site.Following the dewatering procedure the transfer of liquid from the base of column E5 to column E6 was initiated by the control room operator at about 03.15 a.m. This was achieved by opening a flow control valve in a 6"" transfer line between the two columns.At approximately 03.19 a.m. operators working on the plant in the vicinity of the Debutaniser column reported a leak of hydrocarbons (described as a white vapour smelling of ""spirit"") coming from the base of E5 and drifting northwards towards the hot oil pumphouse. The control room operator was notified of the leak and immediately stopped the feed to the unit.At approximately 03.23 a.m. whilst the plant operators were investigating the source of the leak and beginning to isolate valves, the release ignited and the operators ran quickly to a place of safety. A serious fire developed at the base of E5 and this then had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. The fire was automatically detected by a fire detector located in the Hot Oil pump house facing the debutaniser column E5, which alerted the Control Room.The control room operator isolated the feeds to the ""light ends"" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If however the wind had been in a different direction towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.",caus > equipment failure > ignition source,10.0,1,caus > Other (depth-capped)

The ambient temperature caused solidification of the lost inventory within the bund with no immediate risk to people or environment.Wind speed: 1.00, Wind direction: North West, Wind stability: A, Temperature: 5.00Discussion about the Occurrence:The plant had two phenol stock tanks; a larger storage tank (40 tonnes capacity) and a smaller process feed stock tank (18 tonnes capacity). The larger stock tank received road tanker deliveries and phenol needed for the process was transferred to the smaller tank in 12 tonne lots. Process phenol was then continuously circulated between the manufacturing plant and the smaller tank. The level in each tank was measured by load cells informing high weight alarms on the control panel. Shortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund. As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.The operator wrongly positioned valving which set the system up to take phenol from the larger storage tank, circulate it to the manufacturing plant and back into the smaller tank. The outlet of the latter had been closed hence it gradually filled up and passed out of the overflow into the bund.Had the pump mode been correctly selected for transferring to the manufacturing plant, the limt switch on the&nbsp; larger storage tank outlet valve would have been enabled and would have prevented the transfer pump operating, but&nbsp; the pump mode was incorrectly set, by-passing this interlock.Since level measurement relied on load cells, the panel operators' understanding of plant status was flawed. Just prior to the incident phenol had been transferred from the larger storage tank to the smaller (from which the manufacturing plant was supplied). The high weight alarm had been used to judge when sufficient phenol had been transferred and the alarm had been acknowledged. Not enough phenol had been used up by the manufacturing process for the weight in the smaller tank to drop and hence for the alarm to reset. Thus as the smaller tank was filling up the panel operators did not notice it.The investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.",phenol,4.0,3,phenol

The accident event began with a rapid over-pressurisation of the furnace contents in the bosh area due to the interaction of water and hot molten materials. The immediate effect of this furnace over-pressure was to lift that part of the structure above the lap joint upwards, the furnace lintel rising up off the column heads normally supporting the furnace. It is estimated that the structure above the lap joint rose by some 0.75 m. This structure, with its associated burden, was estimated to weigh around 5000 tonnes. The lifting of the upper part of the furnace left an opening of approximately 400-600 mm around the entire circumference at lap joint level. Gases and hot materials were ejected horizontally from this opening. During the period that this gap remained open, some 200 tonnes of liquid, solid, and semi-solid material were ejected onto the cast house floor. Gaseous material and dust rose into the cast house, exited through various openings in the building and into the atmosphere, where much of it ignited. A cloud of ignited dust and gaseous material was thrown several hundred feet into the air above the furnace. The furnace-top ‘bleeder’ valves also opened and discharged into the atmosphere. Gases from these valves also ignited.The furnace then fell back down vertically as the pressure decreased. During the explosion it had twisted (anticlockwise) through approximately 20–50 mm and moved a distance off-centre of about 100 mm, leaving it supported on the lower lap joint plate, with the lintel mounting positions no longer in contact with the column top flanges but instead some 50–100 mm above the column tops. This meant that the weight of the furnace stack was resting, eccentrically, on the lower lap-joint plate.There was little or no warning to personnel working on the cast house floor, although some witnesses later spoke of the event being preceded by ‘rumbles’ within the furnace moments before the actual explosion. At the time of the explosion there were three employees actually on the furnace stack, and several employees and contractors in the cast house floor area. Three employees were within a few metres of the tap hole, with several in the ‘jump desk’ (control room).For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;",incident type > explosion > dust explosion,26.0,3,incident type > explosion > dust explosion

This meant that the weight of the furnace stack was resting, eccentrically, on the lower lap-joint plate.There was little or no warning to personnel working on the cast house floor, although some witnesses later spoke of the event being preceded by ‘rumbles’ within the furnace moments before the actual explosion. At the time of the explosion there were three employees actually on the furnace stack, and several employees and contractors in the cast house floor area. Three employees were within a few metres of the tap hole, with several in the ‘jump desk’ (control room).For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;",incident type > explosion > dust explosion overpressures enclosure,9.0,3,incident type > explosion > dust explosion overpressures enclosure

The fire fighting activities were undertaken by the Navy Guarding Services using special fire fighting tags (water foam). Finally, the burning ship was transferred at about 1.5 km away from the pier installation and six hours later the fire was under control. Meanwhile, the Navy Guarding Services were connected with fire fighting crews from the Special National Fire Fighting Services. However, the next morning the fire, from the machinery shop, reached the first tank and spread, with repeated explosions, to the other tanks of the ship. At noon of the day after, the situation appeared to be out of control. Four firemen were injured. The ship was bent and the fire was extending from leaking gasoline 50 m around. Navigation in the gulf was interrupted and fire fighters tried to the fire from spreading to the other anchored ships. They tried to avoid environmental pollution by using a 400 metres long boom. On Saturday afternoon, about 48 hours after the first explosion, the tanker sank.",incident type > fire > fire-brigade,18.0,2,incident type > fire > Other (depth-capped)

Atmospheric Stability Class: D. Wind speed = 2m/sec (data given by the company).The accident occurred between 11:40 and 11:50 a.m. at the upper level of the building at the pesticide plant, in the water-bath used for pre-heating barrels of raw materials. The pre-heating at 40ö50oC of the contents of the barrels was carried out by means of hot water, which in turn was directly heated by steam supplied by a steam coil (the coil diameter was 5 cm whilst the diameter of the holes of the coil was 0.5 cm). According to the standard operating procedures, the operator had to be always present in the installation and to control the temperature of the raw material. The temperature control had to be carried out by checking the water temperature by means of a hand thermometer and by switching-off the steam valve. The heating of the water was allowed for a period of 2ö2.5 hours as maximum, since long operating experience had shown that this period of time was sufficient to reach a raw material temperature of about 40oC. The day of the accident dimethoate (14 barrels each containing 124 Kg of material) and parathion-methyl (6 barrels each containing 260 Kg of material) had to be heated. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve of the line heating up the water of the bath. Thus, the heating time of the water of the bath and the barrels was extended for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels containing dimethoate. As a result of the explosion (probably due to the friction between the caps and the bodies of the barrels), a fire of dimethoate occurred with subsequent emission of NOx, SOx and mercaptans. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps in other six barrels containing dimethoate. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water (because its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plsnt was not adequate), the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone. It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the wastewater treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea. The plant halted working on 16 of January and started again to work on March of the same year, after the replacement of the water-bath by a new one.&nbsp;It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the waste water treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea.",steam-heat,1.0,3,steam-heat

The first phase of the preparation is the purging of the empty tank through an adsorption system, while being heated by means of an external pipe bundle. This phase was carried out from 27/09/2005 to 30/09/2005 in the morning. On September 30, 2005 one of the the shifts has started the morning shift. The shift leader assigned his workers to different jobs and establishments at the start of the shift. The plant manager starting to work at 7.30 a.m., after getting preliminary information, instructed shift leader&nbsp; to carry out the mechanical works at storage tank HF3 as a task of priority.Discussing the manpower need for this job, plant manager told to shut down the mono-nitrating plant and after finishing-off the ongoing charge, also the shutdown of fluorination plant no. 2 and he was of opinion that the manpower released in this way would be sufficient for the execution of the task. Shift leader, after the decision made by the plant manager, had the mono-nitrating plant shut down. He first sent the workers from there to the foreman to pick up tools and special protective equipment and then the workers had to contact plant manager for further assignments. Shift leader did not clearly interpret the instructions he received from the plant manager with regard to the operation of fluorination plant no.2, because he has dismissed one of the operators from there and sent him to help with the mechanical works and he did not give clear instructions to the other operator to start a new charge or to stop the operation either. The preparations of the mechanical works related to tank HF3 came to an end at about 8 o'clock. Mechanical works started under the on-site supervision and management of plant manager. Neither the plant manager, nor the workers actually involved in the works deemed it necessary to wear special protective equipment. Simultaneously with the mechanical works the actual process steps of the charge introduced in the night shift at the fluorination plant were going on. Upon the completion of those steps the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 has started to feed a new charge with HF feed, as he interpreted the instructions given by the plant manager that the plant did not need to be shut down, he was only instructed to pay more attention during the handling of the HF-valves.At about 9.00 o'clock a.m 3 works from the team carrying out the mechanical works have started to relocate a pipeline section (about 6 m long) dismantled earlier.

The reaction was recognised to be exothermic; therefore, hydrogen peroxide was added at controlled rates. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide plug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was emitted into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident. The oxidation reactor was located in a process room dedicated to the synthesis of 2-chloropyridine with 70% hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide.&nbsp; The reaction was recognized to be exothermic. It was controlled by the rate of addition of the peroxide to a well stirred mixture of the catalyst in pyridine compound. The required peroxide for each batch was transferred from bulk storage to an intermediate holding tank. This tank was located on the ground floor process area and the peroxide was pumped into the reactor via a flow meter. The pyridine was pumped into the reactor from 200 litres drums. The catalyst was added from 50 kg bags through the man-hole. The safety features for this exothermic reaction included: circulation of the reactor contents through two heat exchangers during oxidation; a 200 cm pressure relief line to atmosphere with a 0.7 bar bursting disc; a water quench tank located 3 metres above the reactor, which would automatically dump its contents into the reactor should a sudden temperature increase (&gt; 3°C) occur. The peroxide addition pump would not operate if: the quench tank was not full; the circulation pump was not operating; the reactor's vent was not open to the atmopshere. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide slug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly and resulted in a runaway reaction. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was released into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident. The investigations carried out by the company after the accident showed that approximately 115 Kg of peroxide were added to the reactor over a 3 minutes period instead of the normal 4.5 kg/minute. The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident. For the above accelerated rate of peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 must have been opened. It is thought that an operator failed to close the valves 4 and 5 and opened valves 1, 2 and 3 following the operating instructions. Just after the explosion, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations.",incident type > explosion > runaway reaction and explosion,26.0,3,incident type > explosion > runaway reaction and explosion

Smoke from the fires drifted towards a nearby town about 2 km away. The 450 l glass lined reactor was built in 1979 according to B.S. 1500. It was tested and certified in 1980 and installed in 1980. The reactor was used for chemical reactions at atmospheric pressure or distillations under vacuum over a range of temperatures. On July 28, 154 kg of crude 1-methyl-2-formyl 1-nitroimidazole were loaded in the reactor and heated with heating medium at 100 degrees Celsius, with the intention of dropping the hot liquid into 20 litres glass distillation bowls. These bowls would then be used in the pilot plant distillation unit. Distillation of the crude product at 100 degrees Celsius under vacuum had shown by laboratory trials to yield pure product. When the solid lumps of crude product were almost dissolved, the reactor's agitator was turned on. Shorlty afterwards the mixture began to boil up. A yellow fume began to emerge from the closed man-hole. The pilot plant operator exit quickly and within seconds 2 successive explosions were heard.

The explosions of tanks No 44 and 45 were followed by the fire of the contained methanol. Tank No 42 was also partially damaged because of the explosion of the adjacent No 43: it was still emitting hexane vapours during the inspection. Probably the explosion was caused by the ignition of a mixture of residual methanol vapours with air formed during the degassing operations of tank No 43 (it was degassed with air in order to recover nonane). When the explosion occurred, five workers were working on degassing operations: after the accident, three dead bodies had been recovered and another worker was missed (his lifeless body was found a few days later).

In case that two incompatible substances had to be loaded subsequently into the same tank, purging with air was used (air was pumped in the vessel through a man-hole and was discharged from other openings).

The explosions of tanks No 44 and 45 were followed by the fire of the contained methanol. Tank No 42 was also partially damaged because of the explosion of the adjacent No 43: it was still emitting hexane vapours during the inspection.

In effects, the manual closure of the suction and delivery valves of P-27 pump required about 30 minutes because of the impossibility (due to the presence of flames) to reach the pump. At the same time, the water poured over the plant and, although allowing to obtain the desired cooling, caused the isobutylacetate (and hence the fire) to spread along the waterway for about 50 m. When the fire was extinguished, the isobutylacetate remained in tank V-27 was pumped into a tank truck and then stored in another tank.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

For reasons not yet clear, a considerable release of gas into the atmosphere occurred. A vapour cloud was consequently generated, which invaded the plant. Being not able to stop the release, the man gave the alarm following the procedures, to the firemen, the national railway (whose tracks run close to the establishment) etc. After the arrival of the firemen, just when initiating their action, a first explosion took place, followed by a fire. The fire involved the two firemen teams, the truck-vessel driver and the employee who had given the alarm. The truck vessel was cracked in the above side (a hole of about 500 mm) with release of a big amount of propane and formation of a little fireball. The fire's heat-radiation caused the explosion of a nearby truck-vessel containing only few litres of LPG. A fragment of this vessel (1500 mm long) was found at a distance of 500 m, after it had provoked the crash down of the roof of a room close to a one-family house. Other fragments were spread around at minor distances. The fire, besides destroying the two motor-pumps of the fire-fighting team, affected 2 other truck vessels containing 12 and 35 m3 of propane and an empty truck vessel (12 m3) and 2 railway-vessels of propane (70 m3 capacity) waiting for unloading.The accident originated at 7.30 on 15 march 1996, when an employee of the company was transferring liquid propane from a truck-vessel (35 m3), standing there from the evening before, to the fixed storage installation.

The causes of the accident have not yet been identified, the starting point has also not been determined. Nevertheless it is plausible to assume that the explosion occurred externally of the mixer, due to the fact that the lid of the mixer stayed in its place (original position). The explosion should have had the characteristics of a deflagration. The loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose is performed by inserting feed-line (supply line) through a hatch located on the mixer lid. Eye witnesses have stated that they have seen a flash (fire) develop more or less at the same time of (concurrently to) the blast (explosion). The flash (fire) has fully hit the worker on the lift truck, severely burning him. The equipment (appliances) inside the hall (building) do not show evident damages.The explosion occurred when the loading (charging) operation with nitrocellulose&nbsp; was almost terminated (finished).The access to the hall is blocked due to the demolition (collapse) of the structure. As a consequence it has been impossible at the moment to find any element for identifying the causes and the ignition source.The two operators have declared to have followed the standard procedures. Regular training courses are held for the personnel.The witnesses present have moreover declared to have smelled the presence of ethyl acetate vapours, which are recognisable through the intense smell.More or less at the same time as the explosion a violent flash (fire) developed which has hit plainly one operator which was driving a lift truck a few metres outside the hall (hangar).",incident type > explosion,121.0,3,incident type > explosion

D 528/1 extinguished most fires which had developed.The accident occurred in a section of high-boiling tars of the TDI department TD5. In the department TD5 toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) is produced through the reaction of 2,4-toluendiamine (TDA) and phosgene.The reaction is performed in 3 successive steps with increasing temperature from approximately 80°C to 170°C, with decreasing pressure and hydrogen chloride acid as a by-product.In the section of high-boiling tars, described in the attached block-diagram (ref. Attachment 2), a part of TDI is recovered in a vacuum batch process from the mixture containing 50% TDI and 50%&nbsp; high-boiling tars, stored in tank D 522, which is equipped with a stirrer and water refrigerated coils.The TDI is recovered by evaporation in the concentrator D 525/1, equipped with a stirrer, steam heated coils and maintained at vacuum pressure.Concentrator D 525/1 is fed by the tanks D 528/1-2-3 acting also as compensation tanks. The TDI vapours are then condensed and the liquid then transferred for storage, the residual gas is sent through a separator and then suctioned by the 3stage vacuum units P 509/1-3. The concentrate present in D 525/1 is composed of 18-20% TDI and for the remaining part of high-boiling tars is diluted with toluene, mixed and transferred over a pump in tank D 541, where it is continuously stirred at a temperature of 115 - 120°C with the objective of obtaining a sufficiently fluid and stable mass to be sent into the incinerator B 502/2 for combustion.On 26/11/2002 at about 17:40 the shift assistant of&nbsp; department TD 4-5 shut down the stirrer P 507 of tank D 522 due to the excessive noise of the reduction gear of the motor caused by an insufficient lubrication (memo in the logbook).Following the shutting down of the stirrer P 705 the temperature in tank D 544 started to rise gradually and stabilised at 125°C according to the value recorded by the DCS (Distributed Control System) switchboard assistant. These values cannot be considered&nbsp; reliable due to the fact that the instrument T 5-258 was calibrated to measure temperatures up to 120°C. Tank D 522 receiving the high-boiling tars and the TDI from the evaporator D 521 operates at a maximum temperature of approximately 95°C in normal operating conditions.On 27/11/2002 at 7:30 hrs the feed to tank D 522 is reduced from 400 kg/h to 1900 kg/h maintaining the water circulation in the cooling coils of tank D 522 constant. The reduction of the feed charge reduced the temperature in tank D 522 to 65°C. At approximately 12:00 hrs on 27/11/2002 the temperature of tank D 522 rose again in connection with the increased load of the evaporator D 521, which went up from the previous 1700 kg/h to 7000 kg/h. For the remaining part of 27/11/2002 and until approximately 17:30 hrs on 28/11/2002, when the stirrer was started again, the DCS registered a temperature beyond the top of the measurement scale (above 120°C). At 4:00 hrs on 28/11/2002 the shift personnel registered a temperature rise in tanks D528/1-2-3 and on the work sheet the temperature marked for tanks D 528/1-2-3 were respectively 136-142 and 131°C. The operating temperature normally foreseen for the tanks is 105°C.The switchboard operator reported to the shift assistant an abnormal batch distillation, characterised by the rapidity of the same and the low amount of distilled product, the temperature of D 525/1 was 139°C instead of 105-110° expected at the beginning of the distillation.The operation manual did not indicate the measures to be adopted in case of high temperatures in D 522 and D 528/1-2-3.In the meantime, at 16:30 on 28/11/2002 tank 528/2 filled to 60% reached the temperature of 170°C.The design temperature of the equipment D528/1-2-3 is 150°C.At 18:00 hrs the temperature in tank D 528/2 reached 181°C and it was not possible to discharge tank D 528/2 because distillation was in progress in D25/1 and tank D541 feeding the incinerator B 502/2 was full and could not receive the high-boiling tars from D 525/1.Only at 18:35, when the distillation process in D 525/1 finished, could the discharge into D 541 be performed, only at this point did D 541 have the capacity to receive the content of D 525/1.At 18:50 valve XV 5316 was opened to start the discharge operation of tank 528/2 into tank D 525/1; in that point tank D 528/2, with a nominal capacity of 10m3, was 59.5% full and the temperature&nbsp; 220.7°C. The attempt to discharge tank D 528/2 did not succeed, due to the fact that the not homogenous product inside the tank contained solid matter which blocked the discharge of the tank. Inside the tank unwanted chemical reactions had been going on for hours with development of gas and increase of the temperature and viscosity of the reaction mass.Four external contractors approached the distillation unit D 525/1 to verify the conditions inside the unit through a visual inspection window installed on the dome cap. A dense white smoke inside the distillation unit did not allow the workers to look inside the equipment and the pipe connecting tank D 528/2 to the rupture disk was particularly hot. At 19:25 a second attempt to discharge the tank was made but failed, the temperature on the control panel indicated 220°C while there was no means to measure the pressure inside the vessel. At 19:30 the four external contractors were still in the plant verifying the hydraulic guard D 583 when a strong whistling was heard and white smoke leaking from the flanged coupling located on the delivery tube of the distillation unit D 525/1 was seen. Instinctively the four external contractors tried to escape but a strong explosion was heard, at 19:42 hrs tank D 528/2 exploded. The tank contained a mixture of TDI and TDI high-boiling tars. The pressure wave of the explosion made one escaping worker fall while all were hit and covered by a dense, warm, half solid substance with a high viscosity and a granular structure. After a few (dozen) seconds a fire developed.The explosion ignited a fire involving the terminal part (southern side) of the framework of the ""TDI high-boiling tars processing"" department. The fire was mainly fed by 20 tons of diathermic oil (Aerthem 320) and one ton of toluene due to the rupture of the corresponding pipes.The fire affected the second of the three TDI and high-boiling tars storage tanks, D 528/1 (85% full when the accident occurred), causing its mechanical failure and releasing the second explosion at approximately 20:25 hrs.

The extinguishing water overflowed the retention structure but still remained contained on site, retained by the waterproof external courtyard. At 19:00, power lines were reconnected and one production line resumed operation. The fire was fully extinguished at 22:00. At 01:00 a second production line resumed operation. During the emergency, one firefighter was affected by carbon monoxide. With resources from other departments, a network to measure the level of hydrogen cyanide in the affected area could be set up. The following day, at approximately 10:00, once the hatch had been opened, SCBA-equipped firefighters emptied the silo from the bottom. This work was then taken over by a private company. The inspectorate responsible for classified facilities attended the scene. The safety services completed their work by 20:00. There was only limited damage to the site: The cladding panels of a workshop were blackened by smoke and the crusher was slightly damaged; the silo can be repaired. All production lines, which were shutdown for a few hours and which remained intact, resumed operation on 15 November. The silo in question is used to store two forms of polyurethane dust waste: fine machining dust aspirated off and passed via a bag filter before being transferred to the silo and coarser sawdust particles aspirated off as waste from a polyurethane-panel crusher located directly adjacent to the silo (linked by 20 m of tubing to enable aspiration from the crusher to silo). The dust particles are ultra light, weighing 450 kg per 30 m³. Given the site layout, it is unlikely that the machining section caused the fault (given the intermediary transfer via the filter, the duration of the aspiration process, absence of metal components, etc.). It is probable that the crusher was responsible, considering the fire marks on that device and the fact that crushed panels contain a fine layer of aluminium that could have generated a spark. Moreover, the crushing of panels releases pentane, which can be explosive or flammable under certain conditions, such as, for example, when a crusher heats up. These panels are often the source of fires breaking out in storage containers during crushing. The operator examines these hypotheses in the accident report. The operator is looking into installing a spark detection system in conjunction with a valve diversion or water sprinkler system. Further measures are envisaged: increasing air dilution in the crusher area, installing pentane detectors, and installing a belt or screw conveyor for the open-air evacuation of crushed panels. The crusher will not resume operation until the completion of corrective and preventative measures, the implementation of which will be monitored at the next meeting of the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT).",incident type > fire > fire-brigade,18.0,2,incident type > fire > Other (depth-capped)

At approximately 14:00, there was an explosion in a polyurethane panel crusher; its expansion within the silo increased the pressure and one of the outlet vents gave way, causing a second explosion noise. Subsequently a fire broke out, releasing smoke and gas, including carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The alarm was set off at 14:05; 80 staff members were evacuated and the internal emergency plan (POI) was deployed. The internal safety teams made use of a factory fire hose and called the external emergency services at 14:15, who arrived between 14:30 and 14:45. The power supplies to the site were cut off and rainwater-network blocking valves were activated. The police force and gas, electricity and rail service representatives, as well as the deputy mayor and sub-prefect arrived on site. At 15:30, safety representatives evacuated the industrial and commercial zone (26 persons) and restricted movement for 500 local residents. A safety perimeter was established around the site.

Several teams of the public fire brigade have been intervened until 19:00 hrs on 5/05/2006, when emptying operations of the containment basin terminated.The failure of tank T-3002 has caused the release of approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t.At the date of this report the environmental impact on the soil of the containment basin has been analysed whereas soil&nbsp; remediation measures had were to be taken for the containment basin.",loss of containment > leak,25.0,3,loss of containment > leak

The conveyor has the function to transport fuel, mainly&nbsp; in the form of chips and pieces of wood, from a bulk pit (hole) to the combustion chamber. The fuel is fed, in correspondence of the supply (transfer) point, in the combustion chamber through a lock (gate).

In principle it is possible that an ignition source has penetrated in the drag-chain conveyor from the bulk pit or the combustion chamber. The possibility that the ignition source originated from the bulk pit can be excluded, considering the fact that the fuel was frozen due to the low external temperatures, and that it is very unlikely that the frozen fuel ignites (catches fire). The ignition source could have been transmitted from the furnace, even if the fuel is fed through a lock. Due to the rough (harsh) operation conditions it is plausible that the lock-flaps did not close tight. It is also plausible that the explosion occurred in the combustion chamber or that the under-pressure control was disturbed.Four persons doing repair works on a filter in the direct vicinity of (immediately near) the drag-chain-conveyor were injured by the explosion.

Steam was admitted to the toaster and to the jackets of hexane/miscella inlet pipes to heat-up the toasters and the extractor to the proper operating temperatures. At about 21:45 the toasters reached their operating temperature and admittance of flakes commenced through the inlet screw conveyor. After that, the following events occurred (the time shown had been approximately evaluated on instrument readings and information from the staff, as no log was in operation) until the explosion took place at 00:47:- 22:45 to 23:00: The night shift took over and at the same time the first flakes dropped from the outlet screw conveyor into the toasters.- 23:15: The toaster temperature dropped to 85°C. The plant operator therefore opened fully for the steam flow to the toaster jackets and the upper parts (direct steam) of the toasters. About the same time the safety flap valve was heard lifting releasing hexane and steam into the extractor building, where the smell of hexane was detected by the operators. This was, however, not an abnormal occurrence during the start-up.- 23:25: One of the flake outlet conveyors stopped due to overloading and the interlocking system stopped the flake inlet conveyor and the internal belt conveyor but not the other outlet conveyor nor the steam and hexane flows. High hexane concentrations were detected in the extractor building. The plant operator, however, was of the opinion that the steam and hexane flows were stopped according to the operation procedure.- 23:35: The flake outlet conveyor was restarted and the operating staff began to search for the hexane release point but without success. The hexane concentration in the extraction building finally reached a level which forced the staff out of the extractor building.- 23:55: A bus driver passing the facility detected the hexane vapours and about the same time the sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the released hot hexane/steam mixture.- 00:15: The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (CPO). At the same time they stopped the above mentioned bus driver, when he was to pass again warning him against the possible danger. The bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade.- 00:25: The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance.- 00:35: The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty arrived. The CPO went into the extractor building and located the leak to the safety flap, from which gas/liquids clearly appeared.- 00:40-00:45: The CPO and the Fire Inspector discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to do this by cutting off the power supply. They called the power plant engineer and asked him to do it. Due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer at about 00:47.- 00:47.30: A fire seen in the far end of the extractor yard was spotted followed by a strong explosion injuring 27 persons (staff members, firemen and police officers) and damaging completely 6 buildings.",sprinkler,1.0,3,sprinkler

Similar equipment was already in use for the same production but the new reactor was microprocessor controlled, especially for controlling the chlorine addition rate and the cooling in order to maintain the process conditions (30°C and atmospheric pressure) because the chlorination of 0,0-Dimethyl-phosphorodithiotic acid (MP-1) to MP-2 is exothermic.The reaction took place in extraction naphtha (E-60). By-products were thioperoxy-diphosphoric acid tetramethyl ester (MP-11), hydrogen chloride and sulphur.During commissioning, the temperature controller was blocked while testing the microprocessor and the connection was not re-established before starting operation. The production started at noon and the operators did not paid attention to the temperature that was recorded. Owing to a high chlorine addition rate and no cooling, the temperature rose to be in excess of 120°C about 2 hours after the production started. The solvent (naphta) evaporated and a sudden fast decomposition occurred at 17:55. This resulted in fracture of the rupture disc, in deformation of the reactor lid and in elongation of the bolts of the lid. Flammable gasses were released through the venting system and through the opened reactor lid into process hall. The vapour cloud was ignited when it reached the control room causing an explosion. On the basis of the deformations of the reactor and of the building, Cheminova Agro estimated that the pressure in the reactor reached values of 25-35 bar and that the overpressure in the building reached values of 100-150 mbar.

Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been&nbsp; pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d'Esquadra) arrived&nbsp; at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area. At 20:58 hrs, after extinguishing operations had been started, the chief officer of the fire brigade informed the Control Room that a chlorine cloud was forming.At 21:05 hrs the officer requested activation of the off-site emergency response plan.At 21:11 hrs the off-site emergency plan was activated, the municipalities located downwind and potentially affected by the cloud were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The first fire fighters reaching the site found one extinguishing system of the company out of order due to a missing pressure device.At 21:49 hrs the fire was extinguished and the control room was notified.At 22:15 hrs the on-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off andAt 23:00 hrs the off-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off.",consequenc > fire > two-phase substance fire > toxic cloud,9.0,3,consequenc > fire > two-phase substance fire > Other (depth-capped)

Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been&nbsp; pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d'Esquadra) arrived&nbsp; at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area. At 20:58 hrs, after extinguishing operations had been started, the chief officer of the fire brigade informed the Control Room that a chlorine cloud was forming.At 21:05 hrs the officer requested activation of the off-site emergency response plan.At 21:11 hrs the off-site emergency plan was activated, the municipalities located downwind and potentially affected by the cloud were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The first fire fighters reaching the site found one extinguishing system of the company out of order due to a missing pressure device.At 21:49 hrs the fire was extinguished and the control room was notified.At 22:15 hrs the on-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off andAt 23:00 hrs the off-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off.",consequenc > fire > two-phase substance fire,5.0,1,consequenc > Other (depth-capped)

The stainless steel treatment vessel was connected to a cast iron holding receiver by both top and bottom connections. The liquid was transferred by the bottom connection and any foam generated during the treatment vented back to the receiver using the top connection. When the treatment method was first adopted, foam had escaped out of the open man lid in the treatment vessel. The man lid was therefore sealed. The foam then passed up the vent system and contaminated the scrubber system. Hence the modification to vent the foam into the receiver. The treatment method for the effluent was provided by the firm's parent company which was specialized in hydrogen peroxide chemistry. The method used was first to add hydrogen peroxide (35%) and then caustic soda solution (25%) to bring the pH up to approximately 9. On some occasions foaming occurred. Management did not fully investigate these incidents; some of the operators were aware of a pressure rise in the treatment vessel if the caustic solution was added too quickly. On a cold Saturday morning in March an explosion occurred within the plant. The lid of the stainless steel vessel was blown off whilst the cast iron receiver was blown to pieces. A process operator nearby at the time was killed. A fire, producing an acidic smoke, then very rapidly spread through the entire building.Research followed the accident showed that the foaming was caused by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, catalyzed by the sulphur compounds in the effluent. The decomposition reaction is also pH-dependent. At about pH=7.5, a rapid exothermic decomposition takes place. The heat produced is capable of vaporizing the various aliphatic alcohols also present in the effluent, producing a potential explosive mixture. This mixture would have filled the head space in the treatment vessel and then spilled into the empty receiver. The source ignition was not fully identified though static or spontaneous ignition could be involved. The bursting discs failed in relief vent lines but from the Original Report it is not fully clear if was a component malfunction or a wrong design.

Wind conditions were slight and the vapours from the spilling liquid were not dispersed. In early 1986 it was noted that the flare gas recovery system was operating at reduced efficiency. Gas which should have been recovered was being routed instead to flare. Investigation revealed that a 750 mm valve was passing gas when in closed position. A decision was taken to have the valve removed to carry out repairs to it. It was appreciated that there would require to be careful planning to prevent the possibility of leave refinery units being inadvertently isolated from the flare system. One of the flares would have to be taken out of service and therefore the potential flaring demand of the refinery would need to be matched to the remaining two flares. At a number of meetings of operational and maintenance staff, an agreed flare alignment procedure was drawn up outlining flare system conditions necessary for removal of the valve. The earliest time to carry out the work was to be in early 1987 when 2 of the refinery units and flare No 1 were planned to be out of service for routine maintenance. The detailed work methods and safety requirements concerned with the actual removal of the valve were not considered at the meeting. No difficulties were foreseen and the works were organized and arranged by operations department technicians. Few days prior the accident, the valves to isolate live parts of the flare system from the section under maintenance were closed. Immediately prior to work commencing, the BP technician checked the status of isolation valves and he also identify conditions in the isolated section by opening a small valve on the liquid drain line at a distant flare knockout drum. Finding no indication of gas or liquid coming from the valve he assumed that the flare line was isolated, depressurised and free of liquid. Near the work station were located 2 water monitors to disperse residual gas if it should flow out when the valve was removed. Two refinery fire-fighters were present to operate the monitors and to oversee the use of the breathing apparatuses being used by the workers as protection against potentially toxic residual gases in the flare line. Also in the work area there was a crane to lift the heavy valve and a diesel engine compressor to supply air for the breathing apparatuses. Being everything in order, the BP technician issued the permit to the contractor and work commenced. Two fitters and a rigger prepared to remove a flange ring spacer to insert a blank spade in its taken by a crane. Suddenly it pulled upwards and torrents of liquid gushed out to cascade down over the scaffold.

Six months prior to the final processing the material was oxidized with nitric acid and the products set aside. This led to the formation of appreciable amounts of thermally unstable ortho-nitrobenzylnitrate being formed. This was not recognized and resulted in an earlier exotherm and more vigorous acceleration than had been anticipated. However, immediately prior to distillation, a sample of the crude product was tested using a differential scanning calorimetry method to determine the temperature at which an exothermic reaction would begin. The crude had been washed with water, toluene and caustic prior to testing but the test equipment differed from that specified, and the condensation of water within the equipment masked the identification of an exothermic reaction in the sample. With the information from the test indicating that there was no exotherm likely at and around the operating temperature, the process of distillation of the bulk material was started.

They were drained at each shift from an accumulator vessel into a drain vessel, which was often flushed out with hot gasoil or flushing oil. The asphalt and residual oils were drained to the plant's surface drain and then to an interceptor pit; any propane present would evaporate. The accumulator vessel had a capacity of approximately 24 tonnes of propane at 50°C and 21 bar. During the shift preceding the accident, the drain line from the drain vessel was found to be plugged; after an unsuccessful attempt to remedy this, it was closed. Draining of the asphalt and other residual oils from the recirculating system into the drain vessel was started. After two hours later, a large amount of propane escaped from the drain vessel and drifted 20-30 metres in southerly direction towards the centre of the manufacturing unit. An operator noticed a gas cloud and, at the same time, the propane low level alarm sounded in the main control room. The shift controller manually closed the valve between the propane recirculating system and the drain vessel. The on-site emergency services were called but on their arrival the gas cloud was already safely dispersed.The propane release was attributed to the plugging of the drain valve by a solid plug of asphalt and/or ice, not allowing it fully closing after draining.

Once the pump crackcase was broken, nothing could be done to prevent the release of the contents of the surge drum (10 tonnes were released in the first three minutes).

No one were able to do this as the two gas-tight suits available were preferentially used for search and rescue operations, and thus release of ammonia continued.&nbsp; Ammonia fumes quickly began to enter the plant control room and the operators hardly had the time to sound the alarms and start the plant shut-down before they had to leave the building using 10 minutes escape breathing apparatus sets.

The whole site contained plants covered by the requirements of Article 5; this specific plant did not however fall under the requirements of Artcile 5. The manufacturer had nevertheless prepared a safety report, which was submitted to the competent Authority at the correct time. This report categorized the process as relatively low risk (the reaction was only mildly exothermic and not very sensitive to small operational variations). The process included the production of difluoronitrobenzene (DFNB) by reacting dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB) with potassium fluoride at a temperature of 165°C and atmospheric pressure. DFNB was purified by centrifuge and distillation and was subsequently hydrogenated to difluoroaniline (DFA), an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry. DCNB and DFNB were identified as substances which could decompose violently at temperatures above 220°C but no circumstances were foreseen which could result in the temperature of the mixture being raised by such a large amount above the normal operating temperature. A few weeks before the accident, the distillation mixture had been contaminated with water through two leaking valves. It was believed that the water had been removed by distillation. During the heating phase the operators realized that the temperature was rising fast, but could do little to control it. The reactor vented, flames were seen to ignite at the top of the reactor and then an explosion occurred, followed by a serious fire. Tank storage of xylene was ignited at an early stage and prolonged the fire.",difluoronitrobenzene,1.0,3,difluoronitrobenzene

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION: At 02:00 hours an operator detected a smell of benzene in the proximity of pump P-104. On investigating, he detected liquid escaping from a hose attached to a valve on the pump (this valve was found to be half open and was immediately closed). A sizeable quantity of liquid, thought to be a benzene/water mixture, was observed in the pipetrack. Management was alerted. No other people were working in the vicinity of the leak. It was found that the liquid was flowing along the pipetrack to the jetty and the jetty manager was informed by telephone. A considerable quantity of liquid was found to have collected in a sump on the jetty premises (this was part of the jetty pipeline containment system but not intended to collect liquid from the jetty tank farm). There was considerable soil contamination round this jetty tank farm pipeline (this pipeline did not have a proper containment system). On investigating, it was found that plant instrumentation detected and recorded a slow leak from the tank associated with this pipeline between 20:00 hours the previous evening and 02:00 hours. The leak was too slow to show up on the control panel display and was also masked by a ship loading benzene for part of the time. No people were affected by benzene fumes and no ignition occurred. It is estimated that benzene levels in the vicinity of the leak and along the pipetrack to the sump were likely to exceed the occupational exposure standard. An ignition would have had major consequences.",water-benzene,1.0,3,water-benzene

To avoid greater damage, this part of the plant was put out of service and replaced as a precaution with a PVC pipeline which, according to the specification, was resistant to hydrochloric acid under the ambient operating conditions (temperature and pressure). On 28 May 2009 the shut-down of the desorption plant was started at 10.00 as planned on account of decreasing loading. There was a leakage at around 10.10 of 32% hydrochloric acid from the by-pass line of a heat exchanger caused by a leaking pipe. The hydrochloric acid leaked into the plant's collection basin and was collected there. A detector in the basin activated the alarm (on-the-spot, at the measuring station and to on-site firefighters). Staff of the chlorosilane company were on the spot immediately, the on-site firefighters arrived at 10.13. Once the location of the leak had been identified the feeder pump was stopped. The leakage stopped immediately. A total of approx. 7 m³ of hydrochloric acid 32% escaped. As the formation of acid clouds above the hydrochloric acid puddle had already ceased, the emergency services (on-site firefighters) did not set up a water screen to contain the clouds. At 10.20 the on-site firefighters left. The hydrochloric clouds formed from the acid drifted eastwards (Rhine) within several minutes. There was a westerly wind of around 3 m/s at the time of the incident. It is believed that in the middle of the Rhine the cloud was drawn by the movement of the water away from the direction of the wind and towards a power station building site in the Rhine. At around 10.30 the head of operations was informed that construction workers on the power station building site in the Rhine were complaining of irritation of the respiratory tract.

After completing the works at 8:00 in the morning of 12 October 2006 the work was begun on starting up the KR-601/2 furnace. The burners were ignited in the KR‑601/2 furnace, the temperature was raised and the furnace heating spirals were filled with fuel oil, which began feeding into the K-601 column at 9:28 of the same day. Prior to connecting KR‑601/2 to the system, the raw material was fed into the K-601 column by heating it in the KR-601/1 reserve furnace. The technological parameters of the KR-601/1 furnace and K‑601 column were within the allowed limits. The KR-601/2 furnace was connected to the system by gradually raising the temperature of the raw material supplied to the column. According to the technical regulation of the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar visbreaking section 001 of the combined technological device KT-1/1 for deep processing of fuel oil, the temperature of the supplied raw material needs to be raised by 30 to 35°C per hour. It is apparent from the analysis of the diagrams of technological parameters that from 12:55 to 14:24 the temperature of the raw material being supplied was rising by 38 to 45°C per hour, meaning that the limits specified in the technical regulation were being exceeded. Certain other divergences from the technological regime can be seen from the diagrams of the parameters of the technological regime: - at 9:32 and at 9:48 the vacuum pressure in the column decreased to 104.435 mm Hg st. and 67.018 mm Hg st. respectively (usually the vacuum pressure in the column is about 20 mm Hg st.); - from 13:37 the level of tar started decreasing sharply at the bottom of the K‑601 column, and at 14:24 the measuring devices could not register it at all. According to the technical regulation, the level of tar at the bottom of the column must remain within the limits of 40 to 90%; - from 14:00 to 14:23 the pressure of the cleavage gas in separators SP-603/1 and SP-603/2 started increasing sharply (from 0.53 bar. to -0.335 bar.); - from 10:55 to 12:25 the total amount of raw material being fed into the K-601 column was about 544 m3/h. At 13:55 the amount of the raw material being supplied decreased to 447 m3/h. The debit was increased, and at 14:25 the amount of the raw material being fed into the column was 520 m3/h. At 14:30 the supply of the raw material into the column stopped completely . - At 14:24 there was a complete absence of vacuum pressure in the K-601 column; - At 14:30 the S-608 pump stopped pumping and was operating an empty cycle. The Communication Point of the Operative Management Section of the Fire Rescue Service of omissis received the fire alarm from the K-601 column at 14:32 after the fire safety alarm was set in bases Nos 6 and 7 of section 001. The firefighters on duty in team 1 of the omissis Fire Safety Service were the first to begin extinguishing the fire in section 001, using fire rescue truck PA-40(131)137.

Once the sensor alarm threshold was reached (50 µS), the safety controller isolated the drainage circuit for exchanger condensates by closing a motorised valve. A second conductivity meter, which had not been functioning properly and was scheduled for replacement by maintenance staff, displayed a value of 0 µS. Uninformed of this malfunction, technicians decided to shut off the amine intake at 10:40 pm and extract a sample to confirm their suspicions; they notified the on-call operator, who carried out an on-site assessment of the situation at 11 pm. The operator then proceeded to bypass the conductivity meter in restarting production without waiting for laboratory results to be released. Around 11:30 that evening, external sensors detected a COCl2 concentration build-up. By 11:52, a pressure sensor on the vapour circuit was reading in the tens of bar, triggering shutdown of the unit by closing shutoff valves on both the enclosure confining the unit and the condensate drainage circuit.

Once the sensor alarm threshold was reached (50 µS), the safety controller isolated the drainage circuit for exchanger condensates by closing a motorised valve. A second conductivity meter, which had not been functioning properly and was scheduled for replacement by maintenance staff, displayed a value of 0 µS. Uninformed of this malfunction, technicians decided to shut off the amine intake at 10:40 pm and extract a sample to confirm their suspicions; they notified the on-call operator, who carried out an on-site assessment of the situation at 11 pm. The operator then proceeded to bypass the conductivity meter in restarting production without waiting for laboratory results to be released. Around 11:30 that evening, external sensors detected a COCl2 concentration build-up.

After loading the catalyst into the tank, at around 12.45 they arrived at unit No 3 (Deep Conversion Complex [KT]) to unload it into the B-201 hopper. On the instruction of senior operator R.J., the shift operator G.S. went to hopper B-201 to unload the catalyst.

G.S. went to unscrew the bolt to the B-201 hopper. After unscrewing the bolt to the hopper, he noticed that the hose to the catalyst was starting to move. He then turned to look at B-201 hopper and heard an explosion. After the catalyst dust had settled, he turned off the air hose valve and went over to the tractor.

Due to leakage of process solution emission of ammonia occured. The detailed course of the accident was as follows:About 7:00 a.m., after regular check of the installation, a worker reported to his superviser emission of the process solution (containing ammonium carbonate). The emission occured in the upper part of the exchanger. The person responsible for maintenace works was called in deal with the damage. In the meantime the affected exchanger was being prepared for the examination and repair. The exchanger was rinsed/washed with water. This task involved opening and closing the proper valves on a pump and injection of water. After the exchanger had been washed, the process solution was added to the installation but with omitting the damaged exchanger. This allowed the maintenance staff to remove the isolation of the exchanger in order to examine it. After the examination of the exchanger was performed, it was decided that leakness would be temporary stopped with a caulker band. In order to do this the internal recue unit was called. They noticed punctual leaks in a few places. Before they started sealing operation it was decided to rinse/wash the exchanger again (doing this twice, in the same way as for the first time). Whille the caulker band was installed inside the exchanger there was water at a low preassure. After installation of the band it was decided to check the tightness using water. It appeared that it was not tight enaugh becasue water was leaking. The worker closed one valve to stop the water flow. At the same time he also opened another valve allowing the process solution to get into the system. The other worker, not being aware that process solution was being injected, thought the tightness tests were going on so he cut (with the valve) the flow of the flow of the process solution. This caused the process solution to go the broken exchanger. Suddenly the upper part of the echanger ruptured causing the emmision of the process solution. Due to its evaporation toxic claud was formed. One warker fell down because of the gust that appeared. The other five workers were intoxicated. All of them were injured and taken to the hospital. The analysis of the caourse of the accident showed that together with the emission of ammonium carbonate also ammonia was released, most probably from the absorption column due to the fact that one volve was partailally opened.",in-leakage,5.0,3,in-leakage

Even though Management of Change procedures were in place, no risk assessment was made for the change in operating temperature of the reactor in 2009. A work permit was granted for the execution of the piping modification.

As the tank truck split open, the gas cloud which had been released via the safety valve was ignited.

Account of events before the accident - On 25 February at 15:50 the processing of the product started. A temperature of 55 °C was then measured in the line from the truck to the furnace. The tank was delivered on 25 February at 10:00 and the delivery temperature was 35 °C. The aim was to start processing at 12:00, but this could not be done because the product was too viscous and the tank was warmed up with steam (6 bar - 160 °C). At 15:50 it was decided to try again to start the processing and from that time the temperature in the feedline was logged. The temperature in the tank itself was lower than the temperature measured in the feedline because the measurement was taken in the feedline to the furnace, where the product had been additionally warmed up through tracing. - On 26 February at around 10:00 (the steam (heating) to the tank was still on) it was noted that the N2 flow, press the tank empty, dropped, but the supply to the furnace remained the same.

The log shows that at that moment the temperature in the feedline was 124 °C. - On 26 February between 11:30 and 12:00 there was a brief standstill in the direct injection owing to the normal operation of the incineration process in the oven itself.

Whilst attempting to rectify a fault on the logic system, the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) failed totally on two occasions.&nbsp; The system was re-set after each failure. However, in between the two failures the flow control valve, FC201, situated between the failed pipe and the Dehexaniser column, and which controls the flow of the Naphtha feed into the column, was manually re-set to 15% open, the normal initial setting for starting up the column.&nbsp; This reduction in the valve opening created a greater resistance to sudden product flow and hence a higher pressure pulse in the feed line (although still within the design capability of the pipework) when the second start up occurred.&nbsp; It is likely that this increase in pressure found a weakness in the feed line as a result of the corrosion, causing it to rupture and release the naphtha product.",equipment > static equipment > piping > valv > safety relief valve failure,5.0,2,equipment > static equipment > Other (depth-capped)

The SCl2 hydrolysed upon contact with ambient humidity, causing an intensive emission of hydrogen chloride (HCl), which was not detected by the column's HCl gas detector (the threshold was at 25 ppm). A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl). The automated system shut down the facility and set off a local audible and visual alarm, while alarm warnings were appearing on the screens in the control room. The internal emergency plan was activated at 13.35, and the 35 employees were evacuated. The internal fire team, supported by 40 external fire fighters, equipped themselves with breathing apparatus and plugged the leak; the cloud of HCl was overcome using 4 lateral fire hose lines. The 120 m³ of water used was collected in a retention basin to be re-used in production. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 16.15. The next day, a specialised company pumped the 800 l (1200 kg) of spilled sulphur dichloride into the retention tank and then transferred to a storage vat. The HCl remained confined in the building. The retention basins were cleaned using a neutralising mixture (water + potassium carbonate), which was then pumped to the factory's treatment plant, where it was treated. A comparable accident took place at the site in 2006 (ARIA 31691). The leak was caused by a mechanical rupture in the recirculating pump of a storage tank which had been filled 50 minutes earlier. This was aggravated by the non-closure of an automatic valve at the base of the tank, despite the fact that it had been activated, firstly by the safety controller when it was shut off, and then by the shut-off at the base of the tank at 13.30. A mechanical problem was the origin of the non-closure of the valve at the base of the tank; there had been difficulties closing this for the past 10 days. The authority for the inspection of classified installations notes that the pump's performance did not appear to be suited to its requirements, considering the large number of maintenance operations that it underwent prior to the accident. For his part, the operator countered that the pump's technology had functioned for more than 10 years without any signs of failure. In addition to having the pump and the valve assessed, the operator put the following measures in place: - The faulty pump and the valve at the base of the tank were replaced, as was the latter's actuator; - As a preventive measure, the weight indicators (weight sensors) of the damaged tank and that of the adjacent tank were replaced; - The cell of the HCl gas detector for the column was replaced and calibrated, as the malfunctioning of the existing detector, which had been checked 5 and a half months prior to the accident (the manufacturer recommends that this be done every 3 to 4 months) had not been remedied by re-calibration; - The valve at the base of each of the four SCl2 storage tanks was linked to the local HCl detection system; - Manual valves used to isolate the recirculating pump were automated and linked to the emergency shut-off system; - A drip tray was installed on the pump's leakage controller in order to prevent splashing from the retention tank.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

This topvent remains open after the test. Leakage tests new feedline on cracker – 4/07: System is pressurized from the supply line on ground level +/- 0.5 bar with decocking air till a blind in the inlet line on top of the cracker Pressure is checked by the panel operator by 4 pressure measurements on the inlet of the furnace radiant section. Decoke air is closed after pressurizing.An operator performs the leak tests (soap test) on different locations on the furnace. He didn’t noticed the open vent valve.After a while field operator asks the panel operator to check the pressure (P-measurements radiant inlet)Pressure readings are OK in the opinion of the panel operator. On the DCS trend there’s a minor decrease of pressure.An operator wants to release the pressure via drain on ground level, but notices the system is pressureless. The operator repeats pressure test and asks the panel operator to check the pressure again.Again the measurements are OK. However, this time the operator doesn’t open the drain on the supply line but he opens a drain on the inlet of the radiant section. Air is released. Pressure loss test is considerred OK.Pressuretest erroneously executed: Downstream the feed valves a check valve is installed in the direction of the furnace convection section. The open vent valve is upstream on the top platform of these check valves. The pressure measurements, used for the pressure loss test are downstream the check valves. The check valves have caused that the pressure remained on the system downstream the check valves. The system upstream of the check valves with the open vent valve had become pressureless straight away. The operator has performed in this case a leak test on a pressureless system. Start-up of cracker – 5/07: Furnace is deblinded. Oven is starting to heat up. Steam flows through the supply line for 20h and also passes the open vent. On the 6th of July, right before the end of the late shift (last action of the operator before his shift switch), the supply line is lined-up with butane.Open vent leak: At the beginning of the night shift a white fog is seen on the top platform.

This estimated 10 m3 release corresponds to 130 kg of hydrazine hydrate, 70 kg of aminotriazole and 5.6 t of aminoguanidine formiate.The workshop was secured. To limit the consequences of this kind of release, the operator partially confined the pollution inside the plant's lagoons while lowering the rate of release into the natural environment (300 m3/hr instead of 800) and feeding clean water (900 m3/hr) into the Petite Baise to dilute the pollutant. Bleach (sodium hypochloride) was used to neutralize the hydrazine hydrate in the drainage pipes. The releases from the lagoons fell below the pollution threshold again after about ten days.The accident occurred during start-up after a routine operation to steam-clean lines and batch production equipment in order to remove the accumulated crystals of finished products. The accident was caused by leaving the connecting valves between the line connected to the steam system and the drainage system open when restarting. The steam injection system using pipes with bleeders dates from 2004 and replaced the previous system which used flexible hoses deemed hazardous for operators. This modification was not subjected to strict change management at the time, as required by the safety management system.In addition, a design fault in the steam-cleaning system, failing to separate the production circuit from the unpolluted water system, is also to blame.To avoid this type of accident recurring, the steam injection lines have been modified and the operators have been trained on best practices.This accident should be notified because the 130 kg of hydrazine hydrate released into the environment corresponds to 6.5% of the Seveso threshold for the substance (T+).

The onsite contingency plan was activated.The odours were perceived several kilometres from the platform.&nbsp; Several dozen local residents and employees of the company felt unwell or experienced eye irritation; the personnel of a neighbouring company (200 people) were confined&nbsp; in a shelter. About fifty employees of the installation were given urinary tests fordetecting biological signs of exposure to benzene.Oily fallout mixed with rain was also observed in a nearby town, along with irisation due to traces of hydrocarbons on vehicles. The operator will pay the cost of cleaning any equipment affected (170 vehicles and 30 homes), representing a cost of 100,000 to 500,000 euros. The operating losses have been estimated at 0.5 to 2 million euros (9 days shut-down). &nbsp;The transition stage between decoking and starting-up the oven requires 2 valves to be operated: closing one of them to permit the release of decoking gases into the atmosphere after going through a cyclone, and opening the other valve to send cracking gases to the oil quenching column downstream. At the time of the accident, a mechanical problem prevented closure of the first valve, which was not detected by the computer or the personnel. Under these conditions, the valve between the oven and the quenching column was open, leading to the emission of 6 t of cracked gas from the oil quenching sector into the atmosphere. The gas emission via the 41 m high flare lasted 25 min until the valve between the oven and the quenching column was closed manually (automatic closure impossible).The operator's fault analysis revealed a failure of the coupling between the electric motor and the shaft of the decoking valve. In addition, the limit switch design (electric type) based on detection of the number of rotations of the motor organ rather than on the physical position of the valve shaft, made it impossible to detect the fact that the valve was not closed.The operator's fault analysis revealed a failure of the coupling between the electric motor and the shaft of the decoking valve.

The onsite contingency plan was activated.The odours were perceived several kilometres from the platform.&nbsp; Several dozen local residents and employees of the company felt unwell or experienced eye irritation; the personnel of a neighbouring company (200 people) were confined&nbsp; in a shelter. About fifty employees of the installation were given urinary tests fordetecting biological signs of exposure to benzene.Oily fallout mixed with rain was also observed in a nearby town, along with irisation due to traces of hydrocarbons on vehicles. The operator will pay the cost of cleaning any equipment affected (170 vehicles and 30 homes), representing a cost of 100,000 to 500,000 euros. The operating losses have been estimated at 0.5 to 2 million euros (9 days shut-down). &nbsp;The transition stage between decoking and starting-up the oven requires 2 valves to be operated: closing one of them to permit the release of decoking gases into the atmosphere after going through a cyclone, and opening the other valve to send cracking gases to the oil quenching column downstream. At the time of the accident, a mechanical problem prevented closure of the first valve, which was not detected by the computer or the personnel. Under these conditions, the valve between the oven and the quenching column was open, leading to the emission of 6 t of cracked gas from the oil quenching sector into the atmosphere. The gas emission via the 41 m high flare lasted 25 min until the valve between the oven and the quenching column was closed manually (automatic closure impossible).The operator's fault analysis revealed a failure of the coupling between the electric motor and the shaft of the decoking valve.

The work carried out on one of the plant's boilers prevented removal by steam of the flaring exhaust gas; a cloud of smoke was visible from several kilometres away.The digester used nickel catalysis to convert hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) at a temperature close to 230 °C. The H2 purified in this way from the CO can convert acetylene into ethylene, which is not the case when it is polluted with CO. The ethylene, which meets a relatively strict specification (5 ppm acetylene maximum) is then transformed into polyethylene.At 11.15 am on the day of the accident, a lightning strike made it necessary to secure the digester on high temperature safety; insufficient supply of H2 to hydrogenate the acetylene resulted in a high output of off-specification ethylene that had to be flared given the lack of any storage facility on the site.

A fire then spread towards the top of the building. According to the results of the investigation, molsidomine decomposition was the cause of the accident (molsidomine is an end product of the process and is not classified under Seveso legislation). Prior to commencing production in 2007, the company carried out tests to determine the decomposition temperature of pure molsidomine (151 °C). Given that the temperature of the process does not normally exceed 55 to 60 °C, the company believed the process operated under safe conditions. The accident ultimately occurred during the 9th production run. In reality, at the stage in the process at which the explosion occurred, 300 kg of molsidomine and 275 kg of pyridinium salts (product of the reaction between the solvent pyridine (R11) and HCl) remained in the reactor.The pyridine was fully distilled at the time of the explosion and only traces were left in the reactor. Tests carried out after the accident demonstrate that the decomposition temperature of this mixture (molsidomine + salts) is 91 °C. The TD24 safe handling temperature is 65 °C (there is no risk of explosion if heated for 24 hours) and the hazardous temperature begins at 75 °C (there is a risk of explosion if exposed to heat for 1 to 8 hours), while the reaction process takes 7 hours. The double-jacketed reactor was steam-heated and as a result it is likely that the temperature in some parts of it exceeded 75 °C (in the gas phase). The decomposition of the mixture could therefore begin and then sustain its own heatingin blobs onto the reactor wall in the gas phase.

The convex base welded to a heat-insulated, high-pressure water vapour pipe connected to catalytic reforming equipment had burst prior to ignition. The base, a 40-kg block of steel, was projected longitudinally. Inside the shop area, a walkway was ripped off its supports damaging an access ladder. The steel base crossed the ammonia confinement space 25 m further, without causing any damage, then flew over an ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land 230 m away in a parking zone for tanker cars full of ammonia awaiting shipment, which on that day happened to be empty. The water vapour, circulated at 520°C under 120 bar of pressure in the pipeline, tore apart the asbestos cement cladding on the wall located 20 m from the original rupture and escaped into the atmosphere with a load accompanying noise. The two employees present in the unit at the time cut off vapour supply to stop the sound, shut down production operations and cooled the steam reformer with nitrogen. At 11:50 pm, the plant's internal emergency plan was activated by the operator, yet he failed to sound the siren or notify neighbouring localities. Alerted by the outside noise, local residents called emergency services around midnight; first responders arrived onsite with a crew of 55 men and several utility vehicles. No intervention was required on their part.

Emergency services were activated, the fire was extinguished by the on-site fire service, and all of the facility’s systems were shut down by 22.40. One worker suffered serious burns during the incident. The fire caused extensive damage to the facility, in particular to the electrical cables and data communication. According to statements made by the plant manager, material damage amounted to about €3 million to €4 million. The investigation found that the incident was caused by unforeseen excess pressure in a preparation tank for a radical initiator. During a filling procedure, AIBN was released in the form of a dust cloud, which then ignited, injuring the employee working in the area. A second deflagration occurred when three open AIBN drums, which were near the reactor, ignited. This second deflagration was stronger than the first, and caused the extensive damage to cables and an electrical room. When the process control system activated the alarm, the system was shut down to put it in a safe condition. All input of material ceased, and the remaining reaction heat in the reactor was removed as quickly as possible using water in the cooling circuit. Within about 30 minutes the remaining initiator was used up, polymerisation stopped and the reactor cooled to room temperature. Sequence of events: 19 October 2011 Following a stoppage, the reactor was put back into operation and approximately 400 litres of AMS/ACN solution was poured in to seal the output pumps. Various problems with the ACN intake valves, as well other system valves, led to operation being suspended so that the intake system could be examined. It was subsequently established that the problems were caused by a faulty software update to the DCS system. As a result, the software update was repeated without further problems. The software error itself is not considered to be the cause or a contributing aspect of the incident. 23 October 2011 13.30: For the current production in the reactor, a new starting solution was created; the system was working normally, with no signs of any anomalies. 20.13: The shift workers determined that the reactor (due to the above problem of the inoperative intake system) was showing a pressure of 3 bars. A manual valve was opened to release pressure from the tank into the emergency release tank. The shift workers were not aware, nor could they have noticed, that releasing pressure from the reactor led to a pressure build-up in the emergency release tank. A subsequent calculation of the pressure patterns showed that the decrease in pressure in the reactor from 3 bars at 20.14 to 2.1 bars at 21.03 led to an increase in pressure in the emergency release tank from 1 bar to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.25: The growing pressure in the emergency release tank reached 1.2 bars, causing the white oil contained in the immersion tank to be pushed into the preparation tank. This assumption was confirmed by analyses of the contents of the preparation tank after the incident, which revealed the presence of white oil. Furthermore, in the gas phase of the preparation tank, organic compounds (acrylonitrile) were detected. This shows that the gas phases of the emergency release tank and of the preparation tank were connected and at the same pressure level at this time. The pressure in this combined system continued to grow to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.30: A worker left the measuring station to prepare the next batch of AIBN starting solution to be added to the preparation tank. He removed four drums of AIBN from storage and placed them on a trolley, removed all four lids and placed the first drum in the drum tipper. This was normal procedure. Approx. 20.50: The first drum was swung over the preparation tank and the slide valve on the tank was opened. As the second slide valve opened, a dust cloud issued from the funnel of the drum tipper, ignited and injured the worker, who at that point was standing at the drum tipper’s control panel. A reconstruction of this situation shows that, when the second slide valve on the drum was opened, the excess pressure of 1.7 bars in the preparation tank lifted the drum out of the funnel by at least a few centimetres. The excess pressure blew the powdered AIBN out of the drum and into the surrounding area, leading to a dust cloud, which subsequently ignited. This ignition could have happened one of two ways: a) A brush discharge onto metal parts can lead to ignition of the mixture of AIBN powder and the gas phase containing organic components, or b) Ignition caused by brush discharge onto the inner lining of the drum. Both possibilities could arise from the drum being lifted up by the excess pressure and the resulting gap between the drum and the funnel, if a highly charged dust cloud with a high gas velocity issues from the gap. 21.03: The shift workers at the measuring station heard an explosion and saw multiple gas detector alerts on their screens. In front of the measuring station, they found the injured worker, who was wet from the emergency shower when he came into the measuring station. They noticed a large fire in the area of the drum tipper and immediately alerted the fire service and the emergency doctor. Because of the fire and the damage done to the cables, most of the DCS information was cut off. The investigation after the incident showed that the injured worker had most likely opened all four drums and left the lids on a shelf on the wall. The drum, which had been swung over the preparation tank, exhibited a large hole and was empty, and the metal rings of the other drums were found near the trolley that had been used to transport the drums from storage to the drum tipper. It is clear that, a couple of minutes after the first fire occurred, the fire caused by the dust cloud had ignited the other three drums (this was the explosion heard by the shift workers) and the cables on the wall behind the drums. 21.11: The on-site fire service fought the fire; all other persons evacuated the building. The cables on the wall bracket led to the central electrical room, behind the wall and one floor up. Some of the cables passed through the wall through sand traps, which were fire resistant, while others led to the electrical room through Hauff cable ducts with insufficient fire resistance. 21.36: Fire under control, worker on way to specialist clinic. 22.40: Fire extinguished, although the on-site fire service posted a fire watch until the next morning.",incident type > explosion > chemical explosion,184.0,3,incident type > explosion > chemical explosion

The TDI circuit pump was shut down and the TDI pipeline to the heat exchanger was closed off. Initial troubleshooting by staff. From approx. 08:30 supported by specialist firm which carried out the installation. The cause was identified as using the wrong pipelines. When the heat exchanger was fitted the product inlet (TDI) and the cooling water outlet from the heat exchanger were mixed up. This resulted in a short-circuit between the coolant (ethylene glycol/water) and the product (TDI). At that point it was not apparent that coolant had entered the TDI tank. It was not possible to foresee the subsequent effects of this. At approx. 11:30 the operating crew noticed that steam was coming out of the tank storage facility. They then inspected the tank storage facility and found that the steam was coming out of one TDI tank and that the tank had a raised temperature. The production management then immediately informed the company management. In addition, the production manager at a subsidiary site and the European Isocyanate Producers Association (ISOPA) emergency call centre were contacted for advice. The steam generation in the tank section of the storage hall had now become stronger and the temperature and pressure in the tank continued to rise. It could also be seen that material (liquid and foam) and steam were being released from the tank as gas escaped. Since it could no longer be ruled out that gas could also be released outside the tank storage building, at approx. 12:43 the operating crew called the public fire service. At approx. 13:00 the first members of the public fire service, police and rescue service arrived at the site. The public fire service was assisted by two works fire brigade units on site. At approx. 13:15 the competent authorities and the appointed external accident coordinator were also informed by the company management. Side by side with the emergency services deployed at the accident site, an emergency and crisis management team was set up in the administration building on 13 August 2013 for internal risk protection and emergency management. The team was made up of company operations managers, the accident coordinator, external emergency services and representatives of the authorities. Since the TDI contents of the damaged tank continued to display an exothermic reaction and thermal instability, to reduce the heat of the reaction the tank and the entire TDI tank storage building were permanently kept under a water curtain by the emergency services. Following the installation of various additional temperature-measuring devices, the reaction in the damaged tank could be measured and monitored, inside the tank and on its outer wall continuously by the emergency services in a safe room. The TDI tank affected had a double wall, which meant that the water curtain had only a small heat-dissipating effect. As described, the tank had to be cooled for several days by spraying (water curtain). Following the provisional all-clear on 16 August 2012, on 17 August 2012 the temperature rose again significantly, possibly as a result of the reduced spraying. The situation did not stabilise until 18/19 August 2012 as a result of the sustained cooling. To be safe, the public emergency response services continued cooling by spraying (water curtain) until it was clear from the temperature readings that the reaction had stopped. The investigation and clean-up work could then begin. The damaged TDI tank was inspected by specially trained fire service staff and other experts at the end of August 2013. The purpose of the inspection was to obtain a better assessment of the residual risk for salvaging the damaged tank and as a result determine the subsequent recovery procedure. Following a thorough examination, by agreement with the company operations managers, the local emergency services and representatives of the authorities, the tank and its remaining contents were disposed of safely with the aid of a specialised firm in September 2013 using a special industrial cleaning method (suction method).

With the shop in a down period, a pressure transmitter had been disassembled the previous day in order to proceed with maintenance on the high-pressure NH3 compression circuit. This transmitter, which was performing a dual function, made it possible to regulate refrigeration circuit pressure at a recommended value of 13 bar and thereby ensure installation safety with a trigger value set at 14 bar. The workshop resumed operations the following morning while the transmitter was still being repaired. With no regulation or safety protection in place, the system diverged and the NH3 circuit rose in both temperature and pressure. The circuit safety valve was activated, and 200 kg of NH3 were discharged through a vent 17 m high.",chemical > type > ammonia,5.0,3,chemical > type > ammonia

This was successful after 60 hours, when a 4 cm hole was discovered at a depth of 4 m in cast-iron piping (DN 400, PS=18 mbar) connecting two of the plant's digesters to the gasholders. 24 000 m³ of biogas was lost as a result of the leak. Since they could not be shut down, the output of these digesters was reduced by shutting off the mixing, heating and intake of sludge; the biogas zone was sealed off and ventilation was set up near the leak. A sleeve was placed over the leaky section, which was secured until the complete shutdown of the digesters it fed into, and its output (18 500 m³ of biogas) was progressively released into the atmosphere through the release valves. A segment of the pipe collapsed during the work, rendering repair impossible. The section of pipe was then isolated using a reversible joint of the 'panhandle' type. The biogas network and the station's other digesters were then put back into operation. The two digesters in question were cocooned (with mixing once per week) pending the replacement of the broken section of pipe, causing a production loss of 5% or EUR 160 000.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

Further investigations (excavations inside the plant area and inspections of sewers outside it) led to the discovery of a widespread groundwater contamination combined with the presence of hydrocarbons at external sewers and consequently the assessing of the existence of an occurring uncontrolled emission of hydrocarbons involving subsoil and aquifer underlying the plant as well as a migration of contamination in areas outside its perimeter.The results of the surveys carried out on the tanks after their dismantling for the installation of the double hulls made it possible to ascertain that the event consisted in: &nbsp;- loss of containment of one tank caused by corrosion of the bottom, &nbsp;- product leakage in the layers underlying the bottom of the tank itself (foundation side) for the probable presence of cracks in the bituminous (flexible) sheath presumably due to the contact&nbsp;with the annular (rigid) concrete foundation. This caused the vertical migration of crude oil from the unsaturated zone to the underlying saturated&nbsp; zone (freatic acquifer) at about 6 meters in depth. Subsequently, the presence below the oil tank of a preferential horizontal way of drainage of groundwater, consisting of the intubated and underground tract of a paleo-ditch, favored the drainage and rapid migration of the hydrocarbon plume into separate phase in the southwest direction and its extension outside the perimeter of the plant.",loss of containment > spill > polluting spill,4.0,2,loss of containment > spill > Other (depth-capped)

Since monday 10th there had been operational problems with the H2S-reactor, sludge had accumulated at the bottom of the reactor, and this was being removed by blowing pressurized air to the bottom of the reactor. Two morning shift operators discovered that H2S values on top of the reactor were too high, and communicated this to their colleagues in the shift, but failed to register the information in the shift log, and also forgot to inform about this at the shift handover. The&nbsp;afternoon shift was undermanned, the shift leader was off duty and was replaced with a coordinator from another shift. This coordinator also had other duties on this shift, which was not allowed according to internal procedures, and a third person took over his role, but this was not communicated to the shift. They were als two operators short, and two students who were on a placement program also followed the shift. There was also an operator trainee on the shift. One of the regular operators (operator 1) had been working for many years at a neighbouring plant, but had his second day at work&nbsp;in this plant.&nbsp; At the start of the afternoon shift, the daily tasks were discussed with the coordinator. Blowing the H2S reactor with&nbsp;pressurized air was one of the tasks, and the new operator was given information on how to perform this job. He took with him the trainee and the two placement students to do the job, and was followed by a trained operator (operator 2). The two operators climbed to the top of the reactor, and the trainee and the students were told to wait at ground level, but this was misunderstood and they also climbed to the top of the tank. Entering the top of the tank the two operators felt a strong smell of H2S, but as they had not been told about the high H2S-values during shift handover, they did not bring with them protective equipment. Seconds after the trainee and students had entered the top, one of the students fainted. The new operator reported this to the control room. The control room alarmed both the internal and external rescue services, and the shift coordinator&nbsp;took&nbsp;lead of the internal rescue team. Internal personnel equipped with chemical-diving equipment arrived at the location, and&nbsp;by then the trainee and the second student had managed to climb down from the reactor. Operator 1 had also started to feel bad and climbed dow. He fainted on the way down and landed on a&nbsp;platform, gained consciousness a llittle later and managed to climb down. Operator 2 also felt ill,&nbsp;lost consiousness for a couple of minutes and woke up again on top of the unconsious student. The internal rescue team discovered upon arrival that they had brought one breathing device that did not function, grabbed some spare parts from a first aid kit and climbed to the top of the reactor. One of them had to climb down fairly quickly due to an empty&nbsp;oxygen bottle. It was a hectic situation, with a lot of things going wrong, until the local rescue services arrived at 16:25&nbsp; People from the internal emergency response team and from the local fire rescue services managed to get the student down, and he was transported by helicopter to the&nbsp;hospital.

Course of events‘A vacuum distillation was shut down as part of a planned interim stoppage.The maintenance stoppage is undertaken as an ‘intermediate stop’ in the middle of the running time of 6 years or so between two full-scale shutdowns of the whole refinery, for example to change catalysts that cannot be run at sufficient power for 6 years. In the lower part of the vacuum column (Zone Bed 6), coke deposits build up during operation, which gradually reduces the material flow through the bed, which means that the performance of the column diminishes. For this reason, it was planned, inter alia, to replace bed 6.This work is carried out routinely every three years. The column has already undergone similar maintenance five times in the past. In the run-up to the maintenance stoppage, there were no particular changes to the vacuum column. The pressure loss through the packing had reached the expected value. The yield structures at the end of the operating period also show that operation was undisrupted and as expected during the past running period. There was no difference in the material load compared to previous maintenance intervals; the refinery processes a fairly constant crude oil quality. In particular, there were no elevated concentrations of sulfur. The column system was shut down in accordance with the shutdown procedure. Subsequently, in accordance with a prior risk assessment, the preparatory works for opening the column were carried out. The heading ‘Cleaning of the column by a specialist firm (decontamination)’ is of particular importance. This procedure involves pressurising the column with steam and water, to which a treatment product is added. The specialist firm promises that this will deactivate pyrophoric iron sulfide in the column (FeS2).Iron sulfide always forms in such columns to varying degrees depending on the sulfur concentration in the crude oil and the running parameters of the column.However, as this had been stable during the preceding running periods, it can be concluded that the mass of pyrophoric iron sulfide present is roughly the same. As the iron sulfide formed in the vacuum column has pyrophoric properties when exposed to air, this step is carried out before the column is opened in order to avoid a fire when oxygen enters. This procedure was also successfully completed in previous maintenance stoppages.It is a standard practice in the industry.The instructions to the contractor given via the work authorisation slip and work package preparation in the stoppage planning software stipulated that after opening the lower and upper manholes to vent the column, manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11 would also be opened. In the daily instructions to the company for 16 May 2017, the manhole covers were to be put into place after opening manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11. (Explanatory note: As the manhole covers are very heavy, swivel devices are sometimes used to move them. Putting into place in this context means that the manhole lids are swivelled back to their original position, but are not secured by bolts. A narrow gap remains between the manhole cover and the column.)The instructions also stated that if it proved necessary to run water through the head recirculation line, manhole 11 would have to be closed with two bolts. This part of the instruction was not correctly carried out and all manhole lids were wide open on the morning of 17 May 2017. Preparations for entering and carrying out the work inside continued.At 11:38 on 17 May 2017, a smouldering fire was reported inside the vacuum column. The evacuation of the installation triggered by the alarm was disciplined and speedy. At 11:40, the fire brigade was at the scene to investigate the situation. It was found that the escape route of three members of the maintenance contractor’s staff on a platform at the head of the column was not free. In response, the refinery’s site emergency plan was put into effect at 11:44. Neighbouring businesses, authorities and the public were immediately informed. The fire brigade maintained visual contact with the three employees until they were rescued and used water to fight the fire and cool the column from outside. At 12:55, the employees were able to be rescued using a nearby crane with a passenger bucket. The delay was caused by the fact that the crane operator had quite properly left the plant during the evacuation and a new crane operator had to be called.At 13:14, the emergency doctor was able to carry out an initial examination of the people who had been rescued. Together with the crane operator and five other production and fire service staff, they were taken to nearby hospitals as a precaution. The last staff were released from hospital the following day. The fire was extinguished by feeding in steam from the bottom and firewater from the top.At 14:50 the fire was under control and the refinery’s emergency plan was stood down.

At the time the event occurred, the installation was operating normally.The reactor’s internal pressure was approximately 24 bar, the internal temperature ranged from approximately 130 °C to approximately 148 °C and the flow rate of the feedstock LCP was approximately 32 t/h (immediately before the event, at approximately 5:05, the flow rate was increased from 30.8 t/h to 32 t/h).

Only four of these can be used at the same time. The normal loading procedure is to fill eight railcars (first four, then the other four) and afterwards all eight railcars are moved out of the loading area in one movement with a locomotive. Due to a defect of the plants locomotive, it was temporarily replaced with a rented smaller locomotive, which was unable to pull eight full railcars at once. The loading station is safeguarded with a derailing device, that is interlocked to ensure it is in place during loading. This should prevent entering the loading station with the locomotive during loading activities. This interlock was bypassed by the operators, so that after the first four railcars were full, these could be moved (with the smaller locomotive), while the other four railcars were being filled. Due to a miscommunication between the operators on November 23, 2018, the first and last four railcars were not uncoupled from each other, when the locomotive was used to pull away the first four filled railcars. So the locomotive moved the four full railcars and the four remaining railcars that were being filled over a distance of several meters. As a result, the loading arms of two of the four connected railcars broke, releasing a big cloud of vinylchloride monomer, that was being pumped through the loading arms. The bottom valves on the railcars closed automatically as a result of the railhooks being pulled loose. The vapour cloud triggered the gas detection in the storage bund next to the loading station, which automatically shut the bottom valves of all VCM storage spheres, preventing the further release of VCM. The time of the release was about 90 seconds, the estimated amount of VCM released is between 1.6 and 2.8 tonnes.",UNCAT,,0,UNCAT

The fire brigade came to the scene and in consultation with the owner of the product, the fire brigade decided to distribute the product by wheel loaders in a layer of limited hight over the surface. Saturday evening while still spreading the product a larger pocket of smouldering product was found. By excavating this smouldering product, the smouldering fire intensified which made it impossible to further work with theel loaders in the warehouse. The fire brigade desided not to follow the earlier advise not to use water any more and started to extinguish the smouldering fire with water, shortly after midnight. Due to the toxic (SO2) smoke from the fire, a wide area around the company was evacuated. Several neighbouring companies had to shut down due to this evacuation.

They were only present for this construction work since the company doesn't operate in the weekend. They immediately contacted the emergency services. The fire brigade came to the scene and in consultation with the owner of the product, the fire brigade decided to distribute the product by wheel loaders in a layer of limited hight over the surface. Saturday evening while still spreading the product a larger pocket of smouldering product was found. By excavating this smouldering product, the smouldering fire intensified which made it impossible to further work with theel loaders in the warehouse. The fire brigade desided not to follow the earlier advise not to use water any more and started to extinguish the smouldering fire with water, shortly after midnight. Due to the toxic (SO2) smoke from the fire, a wide area around the company was evacuated. Several neighbouring companies had to shut down due to this evacuation. The fire brigade stayed on the premises till&nbsp;noon on 12th August . They have extinguished the fire with large amounts of fire water. The water in the warehouse and in the drain was sucked into vacuum trucks after the fire was extinguished and was brought to the owner of the product for treatment. A part of the dock was sealed by putting an oil containment boom in one corner. At the surface of the water were floating a number of yellow ‘plugs’, who were sucked and transported to the owner of the product for further analysis. The contained water which was collected in the dirty water tank was treated by the company itself. The dirty water tank was filled for about 85% after the incident. Because of the extent of the incident comprising 4000 ton environmentally dangerous product, this incident is to be considered a major accident according to the Seveso legislation.",incident type > fire,91.0,3,incident type > fire

The leak occurred from a pipeline between a storage container in the tank store and the production plant. The substance that leaked was oleum 65%. This is concentrated sulfuric acid in which sulfur trioxide is dissolved. The substance reacts violently with water, causes severe chemical burns and can irritate the respiratory tract. Due to the cold, wet weather conditions, a fog formed around the site of the leak. The wind speed was about 0.2 m/s, so the fog occurred only in the vicinity of the leak site. At around 10:45, the transfer of oleum from a railway tank wagon began. For this operation, a vehicle of the on-site fire brigade is on standby at the transfer point in order to be able to intervene immediately in the event of any leakage. For this reason, the leak, which was not linked to the unloading operation, was quickly detected and remedial action was taken immediately. After the leak was detected, the transfer process was stopped and damage limitation measures started. The site fire brigade was alerted and precipitated the fog with several fire monitors and water curtains. The competent authorities (professional fire brigade, Darmstadt Regional Council, police and waterway police) were informed of the event by fax at 11:28. In this report, the event was classified as reporting level D 2 (impacts outside the factory boundaries cannot be ruled out). In addition, the Frankfurt professional fire brigade was asked to assist. Using additional water monitors, it supported the factory fire brigade in precipitating the fog. A total of five water monitors, one extinguishing support vehicle and three water curtains were used. In parallel with the on-site operation, a team was set up in the Site Situation Centre to provide coordinated information for the press and to advise the public via a helpline. Representatives of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade and the police were also present in this team. At 11:51 a.m., the reporting level was increased to D 3 (risk likely or already present outside the factory boundaries) due to the emergence of a light wind and the public was warned by the sirens installed at the plant. Staff in neighbouring warehouses were instructed to vacate their premises. Most of the water used to precipitate the leak was collected in the tank storage facility’s collection area. Water that fell outside the collecting basin entered a sewer via the surface drainage system, which drains into the municipal sewer. The outlet to the municipal sewer was shut and the water was thus retained on site. After analyses showed no pH change and no significant sulfate contamination, the water was pumped from the collecting basin and sewer to the site’s biological waste water treatment plant via the chemical waste collecting system. The firm drained the contents of the pipeline in question into a storage container and the pipe was rinsed with sulfuric acid. This made it possible to stop the fog formation at around 13.00. It was established that the leak occurred at a pressure measuring device. After the fog formation ceased, staff of the site fire brigade wearing chemical protective suits replaced the defective measuring instrument with a new device. The subsequent pressure test of the pipe confirmed that the installation was leak-tight. After the successful pressure test, the professional fire brigade gave the all-clear via the sirens at 14:27 and ended the operation. A total of 26 on-site fire brigade and 55 professional fire brigade staff took part in the deployment. In the course of the operation, the footbridge passing through the plant near the tank storage facility and the road to the north of the plant were closed by the police. The environmental monitoring team of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade carried out measurements of air in and around the plant during the release of the substance and after the leak had ended. None of the measurements detected a concentration hazardous to health. Representatives of the Darmstadt Regional Government Office and fire safety inspectorate enquired by telephone and on site about the event and the measures taken. It was estimated that no more than 100 kg of sulfur trioxide had leaked. During the deployment, there were no reports of injuries within the plant either among staff or among firefighters. However, the response team received one report of a child developing a cough outside the plant.

Further investigation showed that 3 possible scenarios regarding the ignition source can be considered. It is not possible to say with absolute certainty what the actual source of ignition was.",incident type > explosion > gas explosion,123.0,3,incident type > explosion > gas explosion

No slurry or other co-substrates are used. Experience suggests that no critical H2S concentrations are to be expected in such a biogas production plant.Nevertheless, a dangerous release of hydrogen sulfide occurred. The causes of the hydrogen sulfide formation are related to the trial operation of a digestate thickening plant operated at the operator’s premises by an equipment supplier in trial mode. The plant had not yet been handed over to the operator. As part of this trial operation, the equipment supplier tried to achieve the agreed process parameters. As this did not work, the operator did not continue the procedure. The plant was shut down by the supplier and subsequently dismantled. The substances produced during the trial and introduced into the existing digestate storage facility remained behind. An expert concluded that microbial processes could be a possible cause of the hydrogen sulfide formation. From the Baden-Württemberg State Office for the Environment, Land Surveys and Nature Protection’s point of view, hydrogen sulfide could also have been formed as a result of a pH reduction by the sulfuric-acid process chemistry combined with the accumulation of sulfur-containing components in the digestate storage facility. The supplier of the plant could no longer be involved in the investigation of the event. Operational data on the trial operation, in particular on the composition and quantities of substances produced in the digestate storage containers, were no longer available. There was no longer any technical communication with the plant supplier. Lean gas, which is used to produce heat in a catalytic afterburner, is stored in the gas storage tank of the digestate storage tank concerned. It is connected to gas analysis apparatus. This showed no noticeable H2S values before the event. The operator had no indication of possible dangers from the stored digestate. Consequently, a hazard analysis, which would have revealed increased hydrogen sulfide formation, was not carried out. It was planned to spread the digestate on the agricultural land in the surrounding area during the upcoming season. The event occurred at the filling plant. During the filling of liquid digestate at a filling station, hydrogen sulfide escaped in dangerous concentrations, the driver of the collection wagon lost control, became unconscious and fell from the slurry container. The driver needs to hold the switch at the top of the container down for the pump to run (dead man’s switch). He was supposed to stand at the top to prevent the container from overflowing. The accident occurred during a normal filling process. The plant was operational. Safety measures:Filling process interrupted by dead man’s switch – no further filling planned.",sulfide,1.0,3,sulfide

A resulting increase in pressure in a hydrogen fluoride (HF) drum to over 10 mbar led to the release of HF in the production hall. This was condensed using a deluge system (inside the production building). Taking into account the effectiveness of the exhaust gas scrubber and the exhaust gas fans – which could be kept powered and in operation throughout the incident apart from the short interruption between the central power failure and the manual switchover to the emergency diesel generator – as well as the monitors (outside the buildings), the additional water curtain installed by the plant fire service and the readings of the emission measurement device before the stack, the total amount of HF emitted to the atmosphere can be estimated at 2.6 kg. The emission measurement device can display four digits, up to 9,999 mg/m³, with deviations of less than 10%. Between approximately 5:00 and 5:30, staff read values between 700 and 800 mg/m³. Taking into account the fall in HF release of approximately 18% within the first hour following the production stop, it is possible to calculate maximum HF concentrations of approximately 1,040 mg/m3 at the start of the power failure. Based on this, a conservative estimate of the amount emitted from the start of the power outage until the end of the water deployment inside and outside the building would be 4.1 kg HF (1,040 mg/m3 x 1,500 m3/h x 2.6 h). The transfer of the power supply for safety-critical power units and equipment to the back-up power supply (diesel generator) was delayed due to a parallel failure of the UPS (230 V). The UPS would have been necessary for the automatic transfer of consumers to the emergency power supply. Instead, this had to be done manually. In addition, the manual switch for the emergency coolant supply failed. The continuous HF vapours (up to 2,700 kg in total over approximately 4 hours following the cut-off of the raw materials) had to be absorbed in the operational exhaust gas scrubber in the end, as the emergency scrubber installed for such an event did not work due to the non-opening butterfly valve in the inlet pipe. The spread of these HF vapours was prevented by condensing using stationary process water monitors and water curtains provided by the plant fire service. The water used to condense the HF vapours was all sent to the internal waste water treatment plant and treated in accordance with the approved discharge parameters.",hydrofluoric,4.0,3,hydrofluoric

The extractors were activated manually. The operator activated the internal emergency plan at 16:25. The staff were evacuated. A security perimeter was established. The fuel supply to the installation was shut off. The heating of the batteries was stopped. At 20:00 the fire was extinguished by inerting with nitrogen. The weakened structure was at risk of collapse. At 20:30 the upstream and downstream valves on the detarrer and H2S scrubber were closed, coke oven gas was restored, nitrogen was injected into the gas collector and the structure was assessed. The operator installed solid joints on flanges to isolate the detarrers and the H2S scrubber. According to the operator, no hazardous or polluting material was released into the atmosphere apart from the (limited) smoke from the fire. The operator estimates the maximum amount of material that reacted in the explosion of the detarrer at 170 kg TNT equivalent. Crude coke gas from coal distillation was burnt in the bleeders (flares above oven batteries) for almost 5 days, which was the time it took to return to service the gas treatment (the detarrer that was destroyed and the H2S scrubber were isolated from the coke gas treatment system and remained out of service for several months). The estimated volume of coke oven gas sent to the bleeders is 3,776,600 Nm³. Coke gas was then flared for 90 days until the detarrer was replaced. In total, the operator estimates that 36,790 t of coke oven gas was released and burned via the bleeders and then the flares. A health impact assessment was carried out and the SO2 emissions were modelled – according to the operator this is the only pollutant from combustion that could affect the public. The operator concludes that neither the daily average limit value for the protection of human health, the information and recommendation threshold nor the alert threshold were exceeded. Following the incident, the damage to outlet valves and pipes was analysed. The work to rebuild the detarrer lasted several months. The material losses are estimated at EUR 10 million and production losses at EUR 9 million. A 25 mm hole and a crack had been detected on the steam circuit 8 months before the accident which could not be repaired without stopping the detarrer. As monitoring of the oxygen level at the detarrer outlet did not show any anomalies, the repair was scheduled for the routine shutdown 3 days after the day of the accident. There are several hypotheses as to the origin of the ignition energy: electrostatic due to friction of the air/gas mixture (also comprising dust) on metal plates, chemical due to the presence of pyrophoric material, or mechanical due to a piece of metal falling inside the detarrer. The external expert assessment concluded that the most likely hypothesis was contact between the coke oven gas and oxygen from the air coming from the leak in the steam network and ignition by electrostatic energy generated by friction between the gases and the metal walls. An electrostatic detarrer had already exploded at this site in July 2005 and at other sites of the group abroad in November 2017 and in 2019. The explosions always occurred when the detarrer was put back into service by supplying the electric fields but never during washing and draining, when the electric fields are not supplied (no ignition source). There were therefore no lessons learned and the risk had not been identified by the operator. Following this accident, the operator reviewed the risk analyses and undertook additional measures, including revising the procedure for washing the detarrer by carrying out the washing and draining operations under pressure in order to avoid any air entry.",incident type > explosion > chemical explosion,184.0,3,incident type > explosion > chemical explosion

Because the plant manager was the only one present at the plant, he postponed the necessary purging of the gas pipeline until Sunday morning. He and another employee put together a high-pressure cleaner in order to use the pipe-cleaning nozzle to remove the obstruction. The high-pressure cleaner was located approximately 6 m from the gas pipeline opening. For protection purposes he was wearing a gas detector. His colleague was operating the flushing hose. After approximately 5 minutes, the gas detector reacted to the presence of methane (CH4), and he immediately turned off the high-pressure cleaner.At the same time, he saw flames pulsing out of the device toward the open gas pipeline. He undertook initial fire-fighting attempts with a water hose while his colleague called emergency services (at 10:13). Then he closed all gas valves in the biogas plant. He did not stop the fire-fighting attempts until the fire brigade arrived.The inflatable roofs on digester 2 and the secondary fermenter were damaged due to the fire, as were the gas pipelines and parts of the control system.Because of a short circuit (burning of the electrical equipment), the entire biogas plant control system failed.As a result, the agitators in digester 1 also failed. Because no mixing was taking place any more, within a few minutes the expanding substrate (high gas activity) overwhelmed the overpressure/underpressure relief valve and both gas overflows. Because all gas domes were already full and the gas could no longer escape through the overpressure/underpressure relief valve and the gas overflows, the gas membrane of digester 1 tore at the seam of the attachment edge.The cleaning of the overpressure/underpressure relief valve that took place following the fire-fighting efforts was not enough to prevent this.

Since water failed to dissolve the hard residue, together with a waste management facility, we initially considered using mining techniques to remove the sediment from the container. The waste management facility took a sample of the sediment and analysed it.The result showed that this method of removal was possible, but difficult because of the spatial constraints, and would be dangerous for the waste management facility staff.As a result, the search for products which could dissolve the sediment began. Laboratory scale experiments showed that the sediment could be dissolved with sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), this was likewise discussed with the waste management facility.H2SO4 did not come into consideration, as it would generate significant amounts of foam and gas.Dissolving the sediment with HCl would not generate foam or lead to a discernible gas formation. Moreover, this mixture would not generate heat. The waste management facility was then provided with a sample of the waste product, the sediment with HCl in liquid form. The waste management facility was able to treat/neutralise this liquid without any problems.Then, a plastics engineering company was consulted in order to check whether the container would be able to withstand HCl. This was confirmed. In order to make this procedure (not part of normal operation) safe, a further experiment was carried out.2 kg of the sediment from the container was mixed with approx. 1.5 litres of HCl (sediment in a container, addition of acid, leave to stand without mixing). This experiment likewise did not generate foam, discernible gas or heat. The timetable was set as follows:Addition of HCl on 13 August 2021.Pickup of the mixture by the waste management facility on 19 August 2021. No anomalies were detected after the addition of HCl on 13 August 2021 ([completed] at approx. 07:00).Around noon, a chlorine-like smell was perceptible in the building.The room where the refilling container, and therefore also the container with the mixture, were located, was then checked. An open manhole was found. The manhole was sealed and the exhaust air system of the container (with a built-in scrubber) was turned on.This took place around 14:30, and the maintenance staff had already finished work for the day. Before leaving, they had turned off the exhaust, because they didn't think it still had to be on.The staff working on the ground floor, near the basement exit, had been told to keep an eye out for how things develop. At that time, it had been assumed that the smell was due to the exhaust air system being switched off and the failure to close the manhole. Following an error message in the fire alarm system, the guards notified the alarm service. The alarm service inspected the room again. By that time, the maintenance foreman was on site, and he discussed the clear deterioration with the plant operator on the phone. As a result, first the fire brigade and then the competent authority within the LANUV (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, State Office for Nature Conservation, Environmental Protection and Consumer Protection) were notified.The staff were brought to various hospitals in the area as a precaution.Around 01:15, it was decided to evacuate the residents and then continue with the removal of the mixture.After the evacuation, around 05:15, the container emptying process began. It was concluded within minutes.After re-measurement at the exposure site – 3 ppm, the all-clear was given and the emergency personnel began the clean-up. After removal of the mixture, the fire brigade measured a value of 3 ppm at the source location – 14 August 2021 around 06:00.In the region of the entrance into the source location (central section/ground floor height difference approx. 4 m), a concentration of 1.4 ppm was measured on 14 August 2021. After closing the entrance and waiting approx. 1 hour – 0.2 ppm.Furthermore, a distinct smell was still perceptible at the external door of the source location. In the view of the operator, this means that a reaction was still ongoing in the source location itself (according to the waste management facility, approx. 1 cm of sediment was left in the container). We believe that the gas formation was caused by a reaction of HCl with components of the deposits.Because of the continuous chlorine emissions, the police initially blocked off the area.After the readings within plant premises fell below the exposure limit values, the plant could be entered again – with the exception of the basement, which remained closed off. The basement was temporarily closed off with foil and tape, to prevent chlorine gas from spreading into the other parts of the plant.The remaining sediments were removed by a specialised company.This scenario cannot happen again because the installation which had caused the sediments has now been permanently shut down.

As a result, first the fire brigade and then the competent authority within the LANUV (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, State Office for Nature Conservation, Environmental Protection and Consumer Protection) were notified.The staff were brought to various hospitals in the area as a precaution.Around 01:15, it was decided to evacuate the residents and then continue with the removal of the mixture.After the evacuation, around 05:15, the container emptying process began. It was concluded within minutes.After re-measurement at the exposure site – 3 ppm, the all-clear was given and the emergency personnel began the clean-up. After removal of the mixture, the fire brigade measured a value of 3 ppm at the source location – 14 August 2021 around 06:00.In the region of the entrance into the source location (central section/ground floor height difference approx. 4 m), a concentration of 1.4 ppm was measured on 14 August 2021. After closing the entrance and waiting approx. 1 hour – 0.2 ppm.Furthermore, a distinct smell was still perceptible at the external door of the source location. In the view of the operator, this means that a reaction was still ongoing in the source location itself (according to the waste management facility, approx. 1 cm of sediment was left in the container). We believe that the gas formation was caused by a reaction of HCl with components of the deposits.Because of the continuous chlorine emissions, the police initially blocked off the area.After the readings within plant premises fell below the exposure limit values, the plant could be entered again – with the exception of the basement, which remained closed off. The basement was temporarily closed off with foil and tape, to prevent chlorine gas from spreading into the other parts of the plant.The remaining sediments were removed by a specialised company.This scenario cannot happen again because the installation which had caused the sediments has now been permanently shut down.

Initial tests and soil sampling showed that the pH value was remarkably acidic. Filling of the tank was then stopped, and its content was emptied into another tank. Initial test results indicated a leak in the storage tank; the product that escaped was azeotropic nitric acid. The supervisory authority was immediately informed of this. Tests and calculations of leakage levels suggest that the leak began around 22 March 2022. According to the analyses submitted, the total amount is approx. 800&nbsp;t. &nbsp; Operational staff tested the soil and noted the unusual condition of certain plants in the vicinity of the tank as a result of penetration of nitric acid into the soil. The tank was then emptied immediately. &nbsp; Tests identified the primary cause of the leakage as a welding defect in the place where two bottom liners met. The imperfection is likely to have broken apart to form a small perforation in the bottom of the tank when the interior of the tank was last inspected. It was not detected during the internal inspection carried out as part of the periodic audit. Given, on the one hand, the small gap between the bottom of the tank and the concrete slab covered with mastic asphalt beneath it and, on the other, the very small diameter of the perforation, it seems plausible that a small amount of acid initially escaped into the gap. However, this small amount of nitric acid that leaked through the bottom of the tank caused a section of the mastic asphalt underneath the tank bottom to dissolve, and the concrete structure beneath was also affected. Under these conditions, a significantly altered corrosive environment developed consisting of acid and the degradation products of the mastic asphalt and of the concrete. In contact with the irregular environment created in this way, the material of the storage tank was no longer sufficiently robust, as a result of which large-scale corrosion occurred from the outside to the inside, leading to further perforation of the material. Most of the acid then seeped through these perforations into the soil beneath the affected concrete slab; this was unnoticeable in the surrounding area. Based on the available information and test results, the material chosen for the storage tank should fundamentally be suitable and sufficiently robust for the planned and permanent storage of nitric acid. The installation and operation of the storage tank are compliant with the Technical Rules for Substances Hazardous to Water (Technische Regel wassergefährdender Stoffe –TRwS 788) and are state of the art.",acid-contaminat,10.0,3,acid-contaminat

In the meantime, phosgene production was in progress in other similar units. The concerned unit was connected to the ongoing phosgene production through a pipeline. That pipeline connection was blocked with a paddle blind, that had been placed between the flanges under the remote-operated pneumatic ball valve. By management's decision, the paddle blind had to be removed.

Naphtha leaked into the bund at the bottom of the tank and activated a gas detector, after which an operator went to the site and noted the leak. The internal emergency plan was launched, and the external fire brigade and civil protection service came to the scene. Initially, naphtha was pumped through the low suction as much as possible to two other tanks in the terminal. Water was also put in the tank, causing water to leak out instead of naphtha. The bund was covered with foam. There was enormous odor nuisance, as far as 40 km from the terminal. On Tuesday morning, June 25, 2024, drone images revealed that there was also naphtha above the floating roof of the tank, which explained the enormous odor nuisance. From then on, the tank roof was also covered with foam. It soon became clear that the tank's floating roof had sunk completely. The initial plan was to expel all the naphtha to above the floating roof and then pump it through the roof drain to another tank, but after about two days it became clear that this operation would take too long to ensure the integrity of the earthen walls of the bund. Since on some spots it was found that product was leaking trough the earth dikes and the integrity of the dikes became questionable because they were completely soaked with water and leaked naphtha. This were still old earth dikes without any form of waterproofing of reinforcement in them. It was then decided to drain the remaining contents of the tank into the bund through the leak in the bottom. As soon as the liquid level dropped below the floating roof, nitrogen was pumped into the tank to control the explosion risk, which was not easy given the immense space below the roof. &nbsp; Finally, over a period of about five days, the remaining contents of the tank completely emptied into the bund through the leak in the bottom. The total amount of naphtha that leaked into the bund is estimated at 2,750 tons (treshold for reporting to the EC is 1,250 tons). The mixture of foam, water and naphtha in the bund was pumped into two other tanks in the terminal, which were also partially filled with naphtha. As the bund could not be entered, this was done with mobile pumps and cranes. After pumping was stopped, a layer of sand was sprayed on the contaminated bottom of the bund to maximize odor control. During the entire intervention fluorine-free foam was used, which had to be constantly topped up because it was much less resistant to water and wind than conventional firefighting foam. Supply was critical at one point, so foam was even transported by train from other facilities. In total, more than 1,000 m³ of firefighting foam was used.&nbsp;",naphtha,1.0,3,naphtha
